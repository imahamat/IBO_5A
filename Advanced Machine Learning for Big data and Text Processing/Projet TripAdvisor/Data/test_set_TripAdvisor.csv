1	3	The water is very hot and there's no cold water at all... It's awful.. The food is not good.. The staff is friendly and very nice.. More upscale items should be offered for the price of the room at 200. A night! Snacks, toiletries, menus and food and drinks offered.. Promote your business... I'm sorry to hear we didn't exceed your expectations but thank you for bringing these issues to our attention. We take your feedback seriously and will share it with the staff. I hope we'll get another opportunity to make a better impression when you return to New Orleans. Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss your stay further. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
2	4	Room was much larger than I expected, and water and fridge were offered for my room - had everything I needed. Nice basic breakfast was included. Room was very clean and everyone here was friendly! Would stay again. We're thrilled to hear you had a great New Orleans experience at the Whitney Hotel. Thank you for mentioning the breakfast and the cleanliness of the rooms. Our staff strives for excellence and I'm glad to see that was provided. We hope to see you again soon. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
3	2	The hotel was alright, this was my second stay at this hotel after my first experience I recieved a comp night to get a better experience. My second experience was about the same, rude staff, bugs in room, room wasn't cleaned when asked and many other things to add on this. For the price of the nights I did pay for, it would be been better to go to another hotel with more comfortable beds. Thank you for your candid review. Upon checking out on Sunday, our Guest Services Manager asked you if your stay was enjoyable, you told him that everything was fine. You certainly didn't mention any of the complaints you list here. We also noted you called for Housekeeping Service to remove trash and bring up fresh towels to your room in the early afternoon on Saturday, declining a full service. Upon reported completion of that task, a Courtesy Call Back was made and you told our Guest Services Agent that everything was delivered to your satisfaction. It's disheartening to read that you had complaints only after you left the property, even though attempts to verify your satisfaction were made by the staff here and, at the time, confirmed by you. We thank you for giving us another opportunity. We sincerely hope you enjoyed your time in New Orleans. As always, if we can be of any other assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Managercasey.callaiswhitneyHotel.com
4	1	Unfortunately, it is not a place to have confidence. One of my children left a small amount of money in the car. When we left the hotel we realized they had stolen it. Although it was little amount of money, the fact is equally repudiable.Thank you for your feedback. We appreciate your recent visit and will use the information you provided here to enable additional training and exceed future expectations. Please accept my apologies for not doing so during this visit. I hope you'll consider giving us another opportunity to make a better impression during your next visit. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
5	2	My husband and I stayed for 4 nights with my 13 month old son and our experience was disappointing from the moment we checked in. When we made our reservation on the phone, we requested a crib for my son and were told it would be no problem. When we arrived we were shocked to see a pack-n-play rather than a crib and they didn't even provide us with a sheet. We called the front desk and demanded a crib. After a few hours, a crib was brought to our room... without even a crib sheet. After many phone calls to the front desk asking for a crib sheet we received a full size sheet for a crib. Apparently not a single person who worked there even knows what a crib sheet is. In addition to the crib and sheet fiasco, the carpeting in our suite was buckling and we almost tripped over it several times. There were also some sink holes in the bedroom. It seems that the hotel is about to undergo a much needed renovation, so hopefully they can also improve their customer service. The location of the hotel was the main reason we chose it, and it does have the potential to be a lovely boutique type hotel with some updates.Thank you for your candid feedback. I'm sorry to hear we didn't meet your needs initially with the crib. We've found that most prefer a soft-side crib over the steel framed ones. Once your requests were understood, though, our desk agents promptly retrieved a crib that was to your liking. We truly do appreciate your feedback and will use to provide better experiences. Thank you. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
6	1	The staff was courteous, friendly and helpful. However, the hotel itself seemed to be a hodgepodge of various updates through the years. It seems staff has been trained to blame it on Katrina but when you stay its clear that the owner has not sufficiently maintained the facility through the years and when maintenance was performed, done so at the cheapest cost no matter how unsightly. the hotel has a lot of potential but is not a boutique by any stretch of the imagination. the windows are original so they are thin. curtains did not properly open and close. AC was loud and inconsistent at keeping a steady temp. using an old mercury thermostat. continental breakfast was paltry compared to others hotels.Dear Josephcarter2018,Thank you for taking the time to review our property. I apologize that your stay fell short of our high service standards. We truly consider all feedback to be a critical part of our success. We pride ourselves on the high levels of service provided to our guests and I am very sorry to hear that was not the case during your stay. Your honest feedback is greatly important to us as we continue working to make improvements and please rest assured that your comments have been heard and passed along to senior management. Thank you again and I truly hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back to visit again in the future.
7	1	We booked this hotel as it offered close proximity to the the centre of New Orleans and it offered disabled facilities in 'superior' rooms. We arrived late because we took the Amtrak from New York 36hrs we arrived at 21.30, very tired. Expecting a decent night sleep we were told they did not have a double room with a disabled friendly shower but a single room on the 7th Floor(they had elevators) with the correct shower. They asked was this acceptable We were so tired we said yes Ok. We were then informed that we would be charges an additional 50 per night for 12 nights for 'extras'. Extras we asked what extras/ Food, movies, drinks, breakfast.We were so tired we said OK. They then hit my card for 3000 - before leaving London we had agreed with our card company that no transaction would exceed 2800 as we had had stolen/lost cards in the past. We had forgotten this limit and the receptionist said the card was rejected. We could not work out why this had happened. So we paid for 1 night with the intention to sort the problem in the morning. However when we went up to the room we were delighted with the bathroom and felt that the size of the room was just about adequate. I was still upset about the card being rejected so I called the 'local' number of my bank. They confirmed there were no problems but reminded me of the limit I had set. As the room did not have a fridge or safe and as we were so tired I decided to deal with the problems in the morning. The following day I went to reception and the manager (i presume) allowed me to pay the bill account on 2 cards saying he understood why this had happened. I asked anbot a fridge he said it would be delivered. There was no safe available. I was not asked to pay the 'extra' this time so payment was made of a further 2200 split on the 2 cards. We went out and on our return found a fridge of 3ft square in the bedroom - so large that it hampered access to the bathroom. We had eaten out so thought we would watch a movie. The TV in our room refused to show us what was available so I rang reception - only no the line was still connected to my European Bamk on the local number. This phone call connection lasted 3 days.and paid 17.98 3minute . So, in spite of my disability I went down to reception and was told that they did not offer movies! As i had paid I could not afford to move and so we were stuck in this hotel. Finally on our last day no one helped with the luggage. I would write a lot but no more room We're glad you found the room size adequate and were delighted with the bathroom. I'm sorry to hear your bank gave you so much trouble with your credit card but happy to hear the desk manager was able to work around it. The reason you didn't have movies is because the 50.00 per night hold for incidentals (like movies, room charges, etc.) was waived due to the issues you were having with your bank and the monetary limits you had set. Also, (and again, in an effort to make you more comfortable) a fridge was placed in your room. I'm sorry to hear you thought it was too large but it's the smallest one we had. Additionally, your phone charges were waived when you didn't disconnect the International call. I am truly sorry to hear you did not enjoy your experience at the Whitney Hotel but it sounds like the staff went above and beyond to serve you and you were satisfied with the room so thank you again for mentioning that. If there is further information you would like me to review, please don't hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
8	4	The Whitney is about five blocks or so from Canal and on to the bars and restaurants of the French Quarter. At night it is a quiet walk past hotels and office buildings once you cross canal returning home. The staff is very friendly in that way New Orleans is. There is a small restaurant for breakfast and coffee if it is raining outside. Rooms are nice and quiet. Would definitely stay again.Thank you for this wonderful review of the Whitney Hotel. We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your visit. If we can be of any other assistance in the future, please don't hesitate to contact us. We look forward to seeing you again soon!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
9	5	For my mother's 90th birthday, she wanted to go to New Orleans (has not been since 1959) and we had a fabulous time. My thanks to the Whitney for making her feel so special, absolutely everyone at the hotel was gracious, helpful, polite and fun. The hotel was completely booked, but our spacious rooms/bathrooms were cleaned promptly and it was not noisy. I highly recommend the Whitney Hotel for the perfect stay in New Orleans...Cathy ThomasNashville, TNWe're so pleased to hear you enjoyed your trip to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans and thank you for the kind words. We'll pass your praise onto the Staff. Please let us know if we can accommodate your next Big Easy get-a-way. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
10	5	I was in town for the Crescent City Classic. The Whitney Hotel is easy walking distance to the start of the 10K race. Also close to the French Quarter and the WWII museum. I like the Central Business District and this location is very central for my purposes, with St. Charles street car close by to the Quarter and the Garden District. Very good value compared to comparable hotels. I have stayed here twice before and will try to stay here again my next trip. Was a good hotel for me.We're so happy to have loyal guests such as yourself coming back again and again to the Whitney Hotel! Thank you for your continued patronage and the wonderful review. We look forward to seeing you again soon!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager

14	4	My wife and I stayed this past weekend at the Marriott Pulse. Nice hotel with great amenities. Good location in downtown San Diego. Only 4 blocks to the gaslamp district with many choices of restaurants in the area. 1 bedroom unit is a little small compared to other Vacation Club properties so would be tight if 4 are staying in one of these units.Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and leave a review. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.
15	1	accused of smoking in my room. only young black kids in the hotel. ima 24 year old well put together chef. needed time away with my girlfriend. Managers and loss prevention kept harassing us. Sunday morning knocked on my door and walked in without my consent and literally said oh i though you were smoking in here and walked out. I was hearing noise all night which i complained about, but nobody did anything about it: yet you're worried about if im smoking when your hotel is Loud and your staff is racist and rude because all of my greetings did not seem genuine. your loss prevention is not an army and i should sue for grievance. I complained about loud banging all morning and nobody did anything or come to see if it was still happening. Instead I got your army of LP at my door accusing me of smoking once again. without even saying sorry for bothering you. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND I AM A MARRIOT REWARDS MEMBER. There were stains on my bed which i let go. my towels were not clean so i requested new ones. You service was so bad , and biased my girlfriend told me not to complain about the towels or buy from your marketplace. This is going to get solved in a court matter. This was the worst experience i have had at a hotel and i travel frequently.
16	5	Stayed here September 2018 for 7 nights hotel was amazing and should be rated a 5 star plus everything was perfect fantastic rooms amazing staff first class facilities great location close to all local attractions would highly recommend.Our team appreciates your review and recommendation on TripAdvisor. We are happy you enjoyed your visit to the resort and look forward to welcoming you back again in the near future.
17	5	This place was recently renovated and our room on the 23th floor felt like we were staying in a hi-end condo with breathtaking views of San Diego bay and the Coronado bridge. Sleek and modern decor with marble countertops stood out to me. There were two flat screen TV's, and a fully-stocked mini kitchen with fridge. Located right in the middle of downtown minutes away from the gas lamp district this place is prime location. The luxurious amenities combined with meticulous customer service especially in the downstairs restaurant makes for a memorable experience that I wouldn't hesitate to highly reccommend over and over again! Great job Marriott!Charles, thank you for a perfect review. We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego. We hope you will visit us again sometime.
18	3	The issues started the first night. Do Not stay in room 1501. Although the room seems like it is a bit away from the elevators the bed room is right next to the elevator shaft. This would be fine if it was just elevator noise but every time it went up and down the banged like the someone was knocking on the door loudly. All night all day whenever someone was in the elevator. I complained the first night to the front desk and actually a maintenance guy, Jared. He said that Otis elevator was actually on site fixing the elevators. They actually came to room but could not figure out where the noise was coming from. I did mention it again on Wednesday but they did not do anything. They could have at least moved me to another room. On Friday I was supposed to meet someone for dinner. I did not have his cell though. I had stepped out of the room for a bit, unfortunately right when he called at 630. He tried again at 7. The staff did not leave a message on my room phone (or my cell/email which they had). At 9 I received a call from the front desk that I received 2 calls at 630 and 7. When I asked why I am just hearing about it at 9, the woman said the note got lost and they had just found it. Oh did I say the pool was closed. Lastly, 1501 is a joined room and on Friday night, at 11 a family decided to have a fight where someone was slapped and the mother and little daughter started crying. I called the office but as far as I know no one came up or called. Just not a good stay. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and leave a review. We apologize for any inconvenience you experienced during your stay with us here in San Diego. Please contact our Customer Care team directly at 800-860-9384 or customer.carevacationclub.com so we may address your concerns personally.
19	4	This Sheraton hotel is very good. The rooms are very big and very clean. Air conditioner works excellent and it's a strong point. The service and people are the perfect. Parking lot avaiable and free. My suggestion is for breakfest, could bring more option of fruits. Just it, but it's very good.Hello,Thank you for taking the time to review the Four Points Sea World. we are happy to hear you really enjoyed the hotel. We hope to see you back in the near future.Sincerely,LBGeneral Manager
20	3	The hotel staff was friendly and engaging. The property appeared recently renovated and well kept up. You need to be prepared for the surrounding neighborhood. it's 100 feet from some of the sketchiest places you ever want to see. Not one but two strip clubs, a couple of adult bookstores and of course, the obligatory massage parlor beneath the bails bondsman. None of this is the hotels fault and I would certainly rate them higher if the neighborhood was a little nicer.Good day Carver123,Thank you for sharing your experience with our team. We are glad you found our team to be friendly and engaging. We are sorry to hear of your challenges with the surrounding area. While there is little our team can do to improve the surrounding area, we are certainly empathetic to your concerns and appreciate your feedback. We hope to see you again very soon. Thank youJGFront Office Manager
21	4	The A/C unit under the window blows air directly on the bed. I like it cold when I sleep but in order to have the A/C on when I sleep it blows a wind chill on me in bed. I had to move yhe room chair in front of the A/C to block the air flow.
22	4	The hotel is ok but considering you pay 19 a day for parking it should be better. There aren't many normal parking spots. You frequently end up in a parking structure in the back and walking stairs to reach your car. Breakfast is as expected at any similar property. Very busy on the weekend. And no matter how busy it is at 10am the doors will be locked. We were done but several people missed out. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Housekeeping pounded on our door and brought us towels at night we didn't ask for and when we told the front desk they acted like it was our fault for not refusing the towels.
23	5	I was traveling to see my son graduate from Marine boot camp and I couldnt be more pleased with the friendly and helpful service I received from ALL the staff. The staff were knowledgeable and helpful with activity tips, dining, shopping etc.
24	5	The most important thing to us is the cleanliness of the hotel, and especially the room. We did not worry about anything as it was fresh and clean every day. The staff was all friendly at all times of the day. We arrived earlier than our check in time but our room was ready so that was good too.Thank you Dolores for taking the time to review our hotel. Our housekeeping staff takes pride in the cleanliness of each room. We are delighted to see that we've exceeded your expectations that our staff had an opportunity to make a great connection with you! We hope that we'll be your first choice the next time you visit San Diego!!!
25	4	Very Hilton-y. I know what to expect. Good service. Updated rooms. Good amenities. When you travel a lot... consistency is fantastic and unpleasant surprises can be draining. Gold+ members get a great breakfast included. Super convenient to shopping, business and restaurants.
26	5	Hotel is in a great location for 5he purpose o my trip. Staff was very accommodating. Check in and check ou5 wa extremely easy. Internet work well, food was good, room was clean and quiet. Will stay here again if Im in San Diego
27	2	If you like King rooms, be prepared not to have a bath. None of their King rooms have baths, only showers. I could not properly wash my hair with a tiny showerhead. Many King rooms have communicating doors to the next room, which are good noise-carriers. With regard to noise: the rooms at the freeway end of the hotel are very noisy, much more so than other hotels we've stayed in on Hotel Circle South. We were living out of our suitcases because of the ridiculous size of the drawers in the room (basically the size of nightstand drawers - see picture). The pool is the size of a large hot-tub. Breakfast had many items but lacked quality: the only good things we found were yoghurt and fresh fruit, cooked food was poor.Hotel staff were helpful and did their best to resolve our issues in a not-so-great hotel. Next San Diego visit: back to the Doubletree.
28	4	Everything about this newer hotel was pretty nice. Two big detriments: 14 to park, which is ridiculous for a Hampton Inn. Really!! And the bathroom doors have automatic closers, which is terribly annoying, especially when you have little children with you. When I commented to the front desk clerk on checkout what a hassle this was, she said, Yeah. I know. It's a problem we're trying to work on, but with 182 rooms, it takes a lot to do all of them. I said, Well, you should at least provide a doorstop in the room. Her reply was, Oh, you could have asked for one. We have them here. Well, why on earth isn't there a notice to that effect in the room We could have avoided a lot of misery. Anyway, the staff was very nice. The breakfast was very good. We didn't have an opportunity to use the outdoor/pool area, but it looked very inviting with a nice lounge/conversation area. We'd probably stay here again, but we'd definitely ask for a doorstop if they haven't fixed the doors yet. (And we might try to strike a deal with the restaurant next door to park for less.)Dear Traveler, Thank you for reviewing our hotel. The comments are insightful and helpful for the hotel teams goals to improve the service and guest experience. Please accept our teams sincere apology for the failures in service that resulted in any inconvenience and lack of comfort. We are grateful for the choice you made to be a guest of the hotel. As you know, we are currently working towards a solution that meets both safety standards and guest comfort for the bathroom doors. We will continue striving to provide a hospitality level that exceeds other available lodging choices and hope that you'll give us another opportunity should you return to the San Diego area.
29	4	When we arrived, the exterior of the hotel was very colorful and set the tone for a relaxing stay. Christian and Lyle at the front desk were very welcoming. They offfered suggestions on where to eat and handed out some free appetizer coupons to local restaurants. This location has a Starbucks's that served breakfast. Breakfast was not free unless you have a voucher from the front desk. Christian was very nice and gave us vouchers for one morning of our stay. The pool is heated and felt great. The hot tub was also a welcome relief to sore muscles from all the walking we did on Old Town. One of the great features of this hotel is that it is walking distance to Old Town and restaurants. It is also centrally located to the freeway and MCRD and not far from the airport. It does have a shuttle on Thursday and Friday to MCRD. and LIMITED airport shuttle service. The only drawbacks were you had to pay for nightly parking and the computers were very slow and the printer was not working. The rooms were clean and updated.
30	4	We stayed overnight in San Diego on our roadtrip. The Best Western is nice, cleen, there was a huge room with two queen size beds. There was free wifi and a refrigerator. We had a quite room on the ground floor.
31	4	I took my almost 13 year old niece to San Diego. We stayed 5 nights at this hotel for a total bill of 307 which is really cheap for San Diego. That price got us a room with 2 queen beds right by the pool (room 103). Room was small as others said but not as small as I thought it would be. There was one night stand between the beds but we could walk around the other sides. The room also had a desk with chair, a dresser, and an upholstered chair. I thought the beds could be more comfortable. There is a plug issue with two outlets where refrig, blow dryer and coffee maker plug in. It wasn't too much of an issue because we just unplugged the refrig when we briefly needed the other appliances. Mirrors didn't bother us and they do make the room feel larger. Room was very clean, bedding was clean and of fairly good guality. Probably the biggest negative was thin walls and doors that you could not close quietly. So we heard noise above us and we were bolted awake one morning by a neighbor 's slamming door at 6:30am. Plenty of free parking. beautiful grounds, sparkling clean pool, nice jacuzzi and great location. Hotel shuttle driver was very nice and reception crew was always helpful. I also appreciated the free computer in the lobby to print our boarding passes. I would stay at this hotel on another trip to San Diego.
32	5	I have had the pleasure to stay here on business and with my family on our weekend getaways! As always, the staff are professional, polite and very helpful to ensure my/our stay is the best possible. I am scheduled to return at the end of the month,.Thank you for being our guest and continually choosing the Best Western Seven Seas for your hotel accommodations in San Diego. We are honored to hear you always enjoy your stays with us whether its for business or leisure. We are also extremely pleased to hear that our staff goes above and beyond to ensure you stays with us are great. We cant wait to welcome you back. Thank you!
33	5	My friend and I have stayed here twice on two different trips to the San Diego area. It is close to downtown San Diego and Ocean Beach which is important to me. We eat over in Ocean Beach but see theatre shows in San Diego. They did not have any 2 Queen bed rooms available upon check in this past visit but upgraded us for free to a King size bed which worked out perfectly. The rooms are dark (can make them dark for sleeping), clean and no bed bugs as I check before bringing in my luggage. I always wish we could stay more than one night as it's my number one choice of a place to stay in the San Diego area. Some hotels charge you for parking which I just dislike. I did my research before staying here the first time and it paid off. We had a horrible experience up in Vista and did not want a repeat of another crappy hotel. Next trip down to San Diego for another theatre show we will be staying here again. Can't recommend this place enough! It's easy freeway access off/on the 8 along hotel row.Dear Jeannette:Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas for your recent hotel accommodations and for being our guest! We are glad you enjoyed our convenient and freeway accessible location, which is close to all San Diego has to offer. It is also great knowing you appreciated our complimentary parking and clean guestrooms. Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are quite important to us, and we are delighted we met with yours! It was our pleasure to provide a great experience and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next theatre trip down to San Diego! Most Sincerely, Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
34	3	it was my last hotel in serious of three during 11 day trip from san francisco so i can compare to few others. the room itself was OK. 2 twin beds that were a little bit small but no surprise there. the bath was fine but the weird thing is that the sink and counter space is outside the bathroom. another weird thing is a full mirror wall on the side of the bed...the walls are very very thin. i felt like the people in the room next door were talking to me. luckily we weren't in the room most of the time but still... the hotel is an open motel kind of space which is nice and has a warm pool at night with steaming water so that's fun. the location at hotel circle is great. close to a lot of things in san diego and i don't think we drove over 1-2 exits in the highway to any of the other attractions. just across the road is the fashion valley mall with a lot of stores and good restaurants if you need to rest.
35	4	Wanted a cheap but clean place to stay, and this place worked just fine. They have a free shuttle service which was great. The rooms were cleaner than I expected for the low price I paid, so I was happy about that. However, they could stand to replace their bathroom doors as they are old! The pool and property were nice as well. Staff was friendly. Would stay here again, especially with their great prices.
36	5	Our stay was very nice. The rooms were clean and the beds very comfortable. The grounds were clean and nice with all the green plants. We enjoyed our stay and would stay again. Also very close to Old Town and out attractions.Thank you for taking the time to review your hotel experience. We are so happy you enjoyed your stay. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit to San Diego. Thanks again!
37	3	hotel has a fresh coat of paint since the last visit. pool area nice. great beds. small bathrooms and the faucet puts out just as much water as shower head when shower is on. very friendly staff. restaurant and bar aren't too bad. good location.
38	2	Gnats in room, I had bites all over my body and due to spraying of raid had a severe chemical reaction to my lungs. The walk ways should have been posted slippery due to sprinkler, someone could have had a serious fall. Table by pool area filthy. Mgr Scott was rude regarding my situation!!!! Will not recommend!!!! Food prices in hotel very high.
39	4	I enjoyed one of the two hot tubs being open late. The cute theme and color coordinated dcor inside and outside of the buildings put me into relaxation mode. The diner on site is convenient. I slept comfortably in the bed. It was over all a quite restful environment.
40	3	This hotel was clean and easy to access after a long day of driving and playing softball. It was in a kind of run down area and the hotel is somewhat outdated but we were just looking for somewhere clean to sleep. For that reason it was great. The staff was wonderful and very polite with all directions and requested information and help.
41	4	A chain Hotel but never the less good value for money with large rooms, quiet ambience, a good pool, restaurant and polite staff. Close to the freeways in San Diego's Hotel circle, the Hotel is easily accessible, it's close to the Fashion Valley shopping Mall, it's on the Downtown Trolley route and although it gets busy, it's never overcrowded. A good value for money Hotel away from the busy beach areas. The Restaurant is good value too.Dear Leonard P.:Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego for your hotel accommodations! We appreciate your nice comments in regard to our large guestrooms, quiet ambiance, good pool, our onsite restaurant-Seven Seas Caf, and polite staff. Our property, as you know, is conveniently located and easily accessible. We are also glad that you appreciated and enjoyed the good value of both our guestrooms and restaurant. Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are important to us, so we are happy we met with yours.Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
42	2	Not what we were expecting from a Best Western. Stayed here with my family of 4 because it was near the zoo and was expecting better from a Best Western. Room with 2 double beds was extremely small, hotel was quite dated and we felt uncomfortable. Thought we could get a roll-away bed with our room but they said it would not fit, They were correctm we could barely move in this tiny, tiny room! Will not stay here again.Dear levine331: Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. We are currently undergoing a 2 million renovation, so exciting things are yet to come. Based on hotel occupancy, larger guestrooms are available, so we apologize if you felt our guestrooms were too small. Thank you for choosing us for your recent hotel accommodations in San Diego and hope you will consider staying with us again, so we may have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience. Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
43	4	Nice , CLEAN, friendly, nice price. I wish the airconditon is not so loud. :) The BW Seven seas in San Diego is the third of the Best Western hotels that I visited and found that each of them is very clean :).Thanks to those ladies who do their part well. I'll be back BW! :)
44	4	good service over all in the hotel in outside the hotel closed to my conference a walking distance, the restaurant got good service and good food, the room was clean, the parking no problem, and it was no smoking on the room it is excellent
45	4	great staff-heated pool-comfy bed-clean room and great location-disappointed with the wifi but otherwise it was very nice. There is a bar and a caf onsite-very convenient. Close to nearby attractionsThank you for being our guest and for your recent review. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed our great staff and our convenient location close to everything San Diego has to offer. We look forward to having you on your next visit to San Diego. Thank you!
46	4	Stayed several nights in June 2012. (Check several sites on the Internet for the best rates under 100 a night. Compare to the Best Western site.)The hotel is more of a motel with exterior hallways and no elevators. The room was small, but clean and adequate. The bed was comfortable, but the mini fridge was quite small. I requested a quiet room since the hotel is next to the freeway. It had a smal pool and two hot tubs. The fitness center was a room next to the pool with only a half dozen treadmills, elipticals, and a few free weights. If you want a serious workout, ask about local gyms or jog along the bay. The grounds were nicely landscaped and the place was very clean.The hotel is minutes from the mall, Old Town, and the aforementioned freeway will start you on the way to Balboa Park. The freeway near Balboa is narrow and congested at times, particularly when the zoo closes and the downtown workforce heads home. Plan on traffic issues.There are many places to eat in the area--ask at the desk. Old Town is nearby, but there are also cheaper fast food places.
47	3	The grounds are dimly lit at night and it is hard to find your room at night. The room numbers are too small to read and not reflective so impossible to see. Parts of the parking lot are narrow and hard to drive your car or back out of your spot without the possibility of hitting a structure or landscaping or planter. The room was smaller than I expected since it had two beds. One bed was up against the window pressed right up on the a/c unit. The curtains were so long they hung over the a/c unit. When I turned it on the air flow blew directly behind the curtain trapping the air flow. I had to MacGyver some decorative pillows to keep the curtains flat to let the air flow into the room. There is only 1 plug by the sink. You can not have a hair appliance plugged in and the refrigerator at the same time. Your choice of cold food and drinks or groomed hair. The room was clean. I do not like the way they charge my room to my debit card. They charge your room rate with the incidentals charge at check in and then charge your room rate again at check out. I checked in on a Friday night. The extra charges came off when I checked my account again on Tuesday. An inconvenience if you are on a tight budget and using a debit card. Overall the grounds were well kept and the room was clean, but had poor appliance, electrical outlet and furniture placement. No elevator for 2nd floor rooms.
48	3	My husband and I drove into SDiego after a 7 1/2 hour drive. (Avoid Hwy 5 if you're coming in from up north. Tons of roadwork). Anyway, the staff was friendly and quick to serve us. It was 2am so there wasn't a line. But it was great to have keys in hand within less than 7 minutes. My issue with this place have to do with:1) no parking 2) how my husband and I had to walk from one end of the parking lot to the other end to get to our room. (I'm pregnant btw, to give you more context). It seemed like there were way too many cars for the number of rooms.3) The bed sufficed though it was hard. We both passed out so it didn't matter too much. 4) The AC worked. But it sounded like the people upstairs were running the shower all morning. 5) There is no tub. It's a stand in shower like in gyms. Not that that mattered to me. But water got all over the floor and you may want to bring sandals to stand in. I have a Best Western rewards card. So I stayed here to earn points. But, note to self: won't be staying here for an extended stay. Can't say I'd recommend it to others.
49	4	I stayed at this motel from 7/11 - 7/16 2012 for Comic-Con. I was wary of it based on some negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was easy, and they let us add a day to the end of our stay at a discounted rate. The room was clean and included a mini fridge and coffee maker. We had the queen suite, which includes a bedroom and a separate living area with a pull out sofa. It included two full bathrooms, both with showers. I showered at different times each morning and always had plenty of hot water. I was apprehensive about using the pullout sofa so I brought a blowup twin mattress, and there was plenty of space for it. The only kind of gross thing was that there were a couple of hairs in the obviously otherwise clean pillowcases - I attributed these to belonging to the housekeeping staff. We asked for more linens and got them within 20 minutes.The room entrances are all outside off the parking lot, but I never felt unsafe as others have mentioned. The door had two secure locks which I used, but I never saw anyone hanging around during my stay that made me feel nervous about security. I did not hear excessive noise, but then again I sleep with ear plugs, so who knows. Nothing noticeable while I was awake. The washers and dryers were nice to have - you will need quarters and there is no change machine. The pool looked nice although I did not use it. The on-site diner-type restaurant was a little pricey, but the food was good. Room service is available until 10PM.All in all it was a pleasant stay. I would not stay there again for Comic-Con, as I realized it would be more convenient to stay downtown, but in general it's a fine motel in a good location.
50	1	The freezing pool. The broken jacuzzi. The unfriendly staff. The rattley old refrigerator in the room. The only cheapest harsh bright white lights used, no night lights. We could hear everyone above and beside us, so the construction of this place is very poor.
51	4	Very good value. They have gone above and beyond to create a nice outdoor environment with a hawaiian feel. Bar could use some serious renovations. Although they had beer on tap I chose to avoid the bar because it was just depressing. Bed was comfortable, good pillows.
52	4	I needed a place to stay near Old Town, San Diego and selected the Best Western Seven Seas. Yes, It is a bit outdated, but a good value for the money. I need to say that when I booked, Comic Con was going on in San Diego. So, I was left with few choices. Best Western Seven Seas came through. This time my stay was great. The room was fine. I was able to use their shuttle bus to take us to Old Town and pick us up afterward. Hotel staff are pleasant and willing to assist. The restaurant is good. No complaints.Dear Carlos G.,Thank you for your recent stay with us and for taking the time to write a review. It was nice to hear your kind remarks regarding our great value, helpful staff, our onsite restaurant and our convenient location. We're glad to read that you were able to take advantage of our complimentary shuttle service. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip down to San Diego.Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
53	3	This hotel Does Not provide shuttle service it is advertised on Trip Advisor as provided but is inaccurate please update as it cost money to take a taxi shuttle or ride share. The hotel is a good value nothing fancy but clean, the staff was friendly. The restaurant is adequate again nothing fancy but the food was good, we had the French dip and chicken noodle soup. Would stay again but prefer accommodations with airline shuttle service.
54	3	The front desk staff needs an introduction to providing better customer service they do what they think their job is, but without any real consideration for the guest in front of them. The room smelled strongly of cleaner enough to make my eyes water. The two control knobs on the A/C unit were broken and amateur repaired so that they did not work. The soap in the bath, down to a sliver, was not replaced. The coffee supplies were not replenished and the waste basket not emptied. They allow people to wander around the facility slipping flyers for other restaurants under the doors not a warm feeling for security awareness. The Cafe served an excellent breakfast good food and excellent friendly staff. I'd suggest you do not pay the up-charge to get breakfast 'included' in the room cost. You can get a good breakfast at the Cafe for much less than the higher room rate, and, if you want to go somewhere else, there are dozens of other restaurants in walking distance. Next time, I'll try a different hotel chain and walk over to the BW Cafe for breakfast.
55	5	Staff was friendly and professional. Rooms were nice and clean. Pool and jacuzzi was great. Breakfast was delicious. We enjoyed use of the breackfast room for my husband's 60th birthday .Our kids and grandkids where all very comfortable in the suites. Thanks again!

Feel free to give us a call before your next stay so we can make sure you have the utmost accommodations.
56	4	We picked this hotel due to its proximity to Sea World. The room was outdated but large and clean. The only complaint we had was we were on the first floor right by the pool. It was noisy most nights up to 10 p.m.Breakfast was pretty good. Parking was free since we booked with a travel agency. Restaurants and shopping was 5 minutes away.We would stay there again but in a room further from the pool.
57	5	Great Stay-I was provided an upgraded suite room. Very nice. Room suite very spacious. All hotel amenities were readily available. Hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. I will definitively stay here again. I like the close proximity to freeway, shopping center and restaurants. Waffle house restaurant breakfast was fantastic and very delicious. Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely,David FuentesFront DeskQuality Suites Mission Valley(619)-881-4000
58	3	Hotel is ok , but need upgrades in the rooms, the carpet, t.v. Is small the bathroom can use up grade tike in floor. When you call front desk and tell them someone right next to you is smoking and you are allergic to smoke. Accommodate me by offering another room, and not say ok and we will check it out. Dear guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments with us regarding your recent stay.i would like to apologize on behalf of the Hotel and Staff members for the problems you encountered during your stay. We do realize our hotel is a bit tired and in need of some TLC ( and we are looking forward to full renovation coming out up very soon. I sincerely apologize for the Front desk not taking care of you properly, I will definitely speak with them and do a refresh training for the issue you mentioned so in the future they can handle it in the proper manner.Again my sincerest apologies. We thank you again for giving us the opportunity to serve you.Kind regards,Laura Benson
59	3	I anticipated this resort having interior corridors like the pictures led me to believe however it did not. The rooms were very old and definitely could use some updating and refurbishing. Outside the hotel a group of homeless people were staying by the emergency exit which did not make me feel safe at all. Not my first choice next time I'm in San Diego.
60	3	Arrived on a Sunday afternoon. Hotel Staff was nice upon greeting. Asked me to upgrade to a King with 2 bunk beds, but I kept the 2 double beds.The label of suite means an extra sitting room in the front with a sofa, small desk, TV, refrigerator, and microwave. The extra room made it nice for our little boy to play while we are resting in the bedroom.AC design is peculiar. Front room gets the main AC, then the room with beds is blocked by a glass sliding door. There is a fan which pulls the AC through to the bedroom. Bathroom was clean, but had a chemical smell. Carpet, wallpaper, and paint all look like they need remodel, which on the hotel website said was going to happen soon. Sliding door to bathroom does not have a lock. Nice to have 2 flat screen TVs. Bed was comfortable.We had a room in the back of the hotel, which made it quiet. The bathroom window faces a bunch of apartments, so you need to remember to close it for your privacy.Price was economical. I read the fine print about the 12 parking fee, I don't think is a big deal. However, they should create a line item in their billing before they quote the nightly price.Breakfast room was convenient and food was well stocked. I would consider going back to this hotel after the renovation. I hope they redo the AC system instead of relying on an old-fashioned fan to re-distribute the air.Dear Guest,We would like to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. Feedback from our guests is very important to us and your input helps with our continuing efforts to provide excellent service and a great stay.Thank you so much for your business and we look forward to seeing you in the future.Kind regards,Laura Benson Operations Manager Quality Suites Mission Valley (619)-881-4000
61	2	The only thing nice that we saw here was the pool, which looked clean and fresh (unfortunately, I didn't bring a suit). The place has very, very old and beat up furniture and was either too hot or too cold -- the heating systems are terrible, built under the window as in older cheap properties and then the beds are behind some sliding doors, so you have to leave those doors open if you want any cooling. The breakfast in the morning is really disgusting. They seem to have people making the breakfast who know nothing about what coffee is supposed to look like, for example, or what bacon strips look like. They had a whole container full of picnic bacon, which is just scraps of pork in no particular shape, generally used as bacon pieces for other foods. And here it is in their hot breakfast like you are supposed to dive in and just eat those bacon scraps as if they are slices of morning bacon. Not me!The coffee maker in the room saved the day for us, because it was actually much better than expected. In a general sense, this room was not the quality that we expected for what we paid, and we were generally disappointed. Complicating the situation, we asked for a wake up call at 10:06 PM one night, and they promised to call. We were never awakened and it caused some big problems. I hope the attached photos help people understand why they should avoid this property.Dear Lindaj99,Very sorry to hear you were so disappointed with us during your recent stay.our main goal is to make sure all our guest have an enjoyable stay.Sorry we fell short of your expectations. the hotel will be having a full renovation towards the end of March.We hope you will give us a chance to serve you again.Thank you again for your comments.Best Regards,Laura BensonOperations ManagerComfort Suites MV
62	5	This place was a breath of fresh air. After traveling for 6 weeks we needed a hotel that could offer laundry facilities, fridge, coffee making, breakfast etc... it has it all. The reception and housekeeping staff were all very friendly, even had fresh coffee and crisp red apples at reception. Frederick at front desk was happy to recommend local restaurants and attractions. Although the rooms are a bit dated it had a great comfy bed and a separate lounge. The daily breakfast was fabulous. It even had a hot dish to offer each day. I would highly recommend this hotel to any couple wanting a value for money stay. Dear guest,Thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to serve you. We thank you for all your wonderful comments and look forward to seeing you again soon.Kind regards,
63	4	My family and I (2 kids 2 adults) stayed at Quality Suites San Diego Sea World Area in early Oct 2018. We stayed in a king size room with a pull out sofa bed. The king bed was very comfy but the pull out sofa wasnt comfy for the kids and wouldnt be able to accommodate an adult. You would be better to get another bedding configuration. The pull out sofa bed was in an offset room/sitting area (with a separate tv) that can be closed with a glass sliding door. The full room is compact so if you have very big bags, they wouldnt be able to be left open all the time as you probably couldnt walk past them. The kids loved the pool, and we could here a little bit of noise from where we were but not much (we were on the 3rd floor in the far corner so it was the quietest area). The breakfast and breakfast area was good. The staff were friendly and the location was central to the zoo and the airport. We used Lyft to go places. You could go across the highway to the mission valley shopping area but we didnt do that. There is a Dennys, petrol station, benihana, Wendys and another food place within several minutes walk (and a Wendys further) on the hotel side of the highway. Overall we had a good stay as it provided everything we needed for our couple of nights.Dear Guest - We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with such candid feedback of your stay. I am very sorry to hear that your stay did not meet expectations. At the same time glad to know that kids loved the pool and you liked the breakfast! I'm sure our entire hotel staff enjoyed catering to your needs as well. Looking forward to welcoming you back soon!
64	2	Nice lush landscaping, nice pool. Close to freeways and gas station. Stayed in room 315. The kids liked having their own space. Hard to take a shower, no or low pressure. Air conditioner didn't seem to be working. I called front desk, girl said they hadn't had any complaints! Seriously I'm calling! Was so hot for 3 nights! There was a stand up fan so I assumed they knew the AC wasn't working. Breakfast was blah. Make sure you have time because the breakfast area was packed and they take FOREVER to replenish the hot foods. Overall, my stay was fine. Kids were happy. Dear AlexLisa02,Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to share your comments.I would like to apologize to you and your family on behalf of the hotel for failing to meet your needs.We understand our hotel is in need of a LOT of TLC, so sorry (We are due for a full renovation in the next couple of months in which we'll have everything in those rooms replaced and upgraded.i hope you will give us a chance to serve you again very soon.Warm regards,Laura Benson OP ManagerComfort Suites MV
65	1	My family and I checked in on Thursday 9/21 around 9pm. The parking lot was very small and hard to get a spot. When we finally got in the lobby, it looked clean and presentable. Our room was an entirely different story. It was facing outside by the pool. The light was already on in our room before we entered. Once we got in I was immediately disgusted. It smelled horrible (almost like a really bad sulfur), room looked very outdated and unappealing. Room was small, beds were old and I was so grossed out. I went to the front desk and explained how disappointed I was and they let me look at a few other rooms they offered--all of them terrible. We stayed put as there was no sense in moving to another awful room and quickly went to bed. When I woke up the next morning there were TWO cockroaches in the bathroom. YUCK! Southern California, I get it, bugs can happen. Every other hotel we stayed at for the rest of the week was so lovely. Very clean, up to date, and well kept. We had a few other family members that stayed in different rooms at this hotel and they were all equally displeased. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL. It ran me 135 after 12 for parking. We had 3 more rooms reserved at this hotel again for that Sunday but we canceled them immediately. Gross, outdated, smelly, and OVERPRICED. Never again will I stay at this hotel! BUYER BEWARE. Also, when I checked out of the hotel, the man at the desk asked me how everything was. I told him You don't want to know and the didn't have any response...not a sorry, to hear that, nothing..Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for failing to exceed your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you provided to make improvements to ensure we offer an exceptional experience for our guests in the future.I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience. Sincerely,Laura Benson Operations Manager Quality Suites Mission Valley
66	2	I recently stayed at this property as it was listed as a three-diamond under AAA ratings and had bunk beds for my two young children. This hotel is not as nice as advertised. The room I had showed its age as it was looking dirty and worn. I also had one of the worst experiences I have ever had with the hotel personnel and management. Their customer service was very poor. On the second night of our stay the Toilet backed up a around 8:30 P.M. I called the front desk and was told there was no one who could fix it so I could move to another room. I declined this, as it would have taken at least an hour and a half to pack up, move, unpack and set up the room. My children were just going to bed so moving and doing the work would have been quite intrusive. I couldnt believe that they didnt have anyone who could plunge the toiled as this hotel has over 125 rooms. I asked if they had a plunger and the desk person stated he would look. He later called and stated that he couldnt find one. (really) I could use the bathroom six rooms down for the night. I advised that this was unacceptable, as it would be disruptive as the kids would probable get up a couple of times. He stated that no one else was there and the manager didnt answer the phone and he couldnt find the plunger. I went out and purchased a plunger. When I returned it took me all of 30 seconds to have the toilet operating properly.At around 9:00 the next morning I went in and asked to see the manager. She refused to meet with me and advised the employee that she was on a conference call and wouldnt be available to meet until 2:00. I found this to be ludicrous and told the clerk so. I felt like making a scene but didnt as my children were there. When we returned from our day at Seaworld around 5:00 I met with the manager. She told me that it was good customer service to only offer a room change. I advised her of how much work it would that would have caused, and how disruptive it would have been to the young children and that it only took me a few seconds to fix the problem after I went out and bought the plunger. I told her she should be embarrassed about the customer service, she advised that she was proud of it and all of her employees. I asked for information on the ownership of the hotel, or her manager. She only would give me the choice 1-800 number. She actually stated that she didnt have that information. I asked for the name of who hired her she stated herself, I asked if she was the owner. She again would only say she didnt have that information. Earlier I had asked for compensation for the situation she insulting only offered to pay for the plunger. In the room was a card titled commitment to your Satisfaction, It stated states that if youre not satisfied with our accommodations or service, please the front desk know so we can make it right. At this property from the general manager on down they do not follow this policy. They definitely did not make it right.
67	4	I recently visited the area for Spring Break. This location was perfect. Close to all of the major attractions (Petco Park, Sea World, SD Zoo, etc). We were very close to the interstate but the location was very quiet. Shopping centers, movie theater, and numerous restaraunts nearby. We had issues checking in and the room type we booked was not available the first night. We were put in a smaller room but we did get a discounted rate for the inconvenience. Breakfast included hot items but they left a bit to be desired but my kids loved the make your own waffles (get there early or prepare to stand in line for quite a while). The outdoor heated pool/hot tub area was nice and well stocked with towels. The rooms were a bit tight (family suites) but they were very clean and the beds were comfortable. There are lots of families that stay here so there was constant noise from children running the corridors so if you are looking for peace and quiet this might not be for you. Overall a nice stay despite a few issues.We are glad that you liked the location of the hotel which is very close to all the attractions, walking distance shopping mall and restaurants. Thank you very much for appreciating heated pool. We very much appreciate and value your feedback and will share it with our team. It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback.See you when you will visit Sunny San Diego again!!!Sincerely,Sarika DesaiAssistant General ManagerComfort Suites Mission Valley SeaWorld Area619-881-4000

69	4	This hotel is located in the Hotel circle area of San Diego. Please note being a San Diego resident, this hotel is not close to the downtown / gaslamp area or tourist attractions of San Diego. You are a good 15 / 20 minute cab ride to downtown. Most people stay at these hotels to be near the shopping malls. You will need a car to get around out here, the freeways around hotel circle are all over the place.The room itself is clean and big, but a little dated and the old wooden furniture could use a change, but understand that this hotel is more towards the budget end of hotels in San Diego, so its very decent for the price and surround by other hotels with a La Quinta property right next door.The breakfast is your average one with choices of bread, muffins and some scrambled eggs and sausage, coffee, or make yourself a waffle and some yogurts are available.The bed was pretty comfortable and i felt safe in my room and could not hear any noise from the neighbors. It's also nice you have a lounge area in your room to watch tv and relax and be away from the bedroom. The room also has a fridge and a microwave in them.Overall this is a good location if you need to be in Mission valley.Dear Guest,Thank you very much for leaving our property positive feedback on your recent stay with us. I am very glad to hear you enjoy our suites and all amenties we have to offer. Our central location to all major attractions is a plus but for some it is about 20 minutes out, which i think is still not to bad. Our Hotel recently changed names from Comfort Suites to Quality Suites. In doing so most items in the bed rooms have been replaced with new products from bedding, mattresses and a few others. Between now and March 2015 we should have all renovations complete. We hope to have you visit us again in the near future. Thank you again for the great feedback! Warm Regards,Laura BensonOperations Mananger619-881-4004
70	4	The staff was the other best thing about this hotel. They were very friendly and efficient, getting our keys replaced (twice), killing the ants eating my birthday cake and clearing the stopped up toilet.This is an older hotel, but the price is reasonable, it was clean and it has a great location near downtown and a mega shopping center. The rooms have some wear, but were roomy with a bedroom and sitting room. There was also free wi-fi, breakfast, computer room, refrigerator, micro and pool. Parking was 12. per night.Nice place if you're not too picky and can keep a sense of humor.Dear guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments regarding your resent stay with us. We are so glad to hear we were able to meet your needs and expectations. looking forward to seeing you back again soon. thank you again for your wonderful comments. )Kind regards,Laura Benson
71	5	Hungry They got you covered evening and breakfast.. comfy bed, quiet. Pool and Hot Tub both nice. The Air worked great and there was an option to leave the fan on all night. Clean and spacious room. Would stay again
72	4	I was out in Indiana for a get together and the Hampton being my go to hotel I stayed at this one. There was an odd smell to the building while I was checking in and it lingered all the way up to the 3rd floor where my room was. Once in my room though I couldn't smell it. The... More
73	5	I have stayed at all the big hotels in the Union Square (Westin, Hyatt, Hilton, etc ) and a number of boutique offerings as well. This may be my favorite one. The valueIs by far the best in the area. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and the vibe is casual/chic. Huge thumbs up!
74	5	The hotel was very clean. The staff are all nice . Situated very near shopping malls restaurants. They have great deals you can avail at an affordable price. We had a spacious room with a king bed and a sofa bed and 2 flat TV sets. There was plenty of space to roam around. Hello MariaLorenaR, thank you giving us a 5 star rating. We are delighted to know that we were able to meet your expectations. Please come and see us again in the near future! Stay vibrant!
75	4	My husband and I stayed six nights of their deluxe double room. This hotel was super convenient. Turn right within five minutes walk is the cable car and all the famous U.S. department stores, like Bloomingdale and Norstrom which are inside the big Westfield shopping mall, Walgreen, the supermarket is just in the neighbouhood. There is a Chinese restaurant and a Sushi place just cross the road. I love the bed in Hotel Abri, there were four medium size pillows on it and the bed was very comfortable. The room was very small but everything was in it, also the bathroom was very small, too. The air-condiitioning was the old-fashioned window ones, very noisy. It depends on what you are looking for, for location, this should be a good choice, everything is within walking distance and there is no need to rent a car because parking is very expensive in downtown San Francisco, valet parking in this hotel cost you US50 a day!The elevator was a bit scary, recommended to hold 4 persons! I saw some people choose to use the stairs. All the staffs were very friendly. There was free Wifi but it also depends what time, at night it is super-slow. My room was very quiet because I read the comments before booking this hotel, make sure you ask for the interior room and higher floors. There was a funny smell in the hallway but not inside the room. All in all, I think this hotel worth the money and if I want to stay in San Francisco downtown, I would surely book Hotel Abri again.
76	5	From the door service man to the front desk personnel to the maid service, ALL is excellent customer service at this Hotel Abri in San Francisco. All the employees are very kind and friendly, and are willing to do everything to make you happy. I spoke with the manager as well, and he was very kind and willing to talk to us to make sure we had an excellent stay. If I ever get back to San Francisco, I will stay at the Hotel Abri again. It's in a great location 1 block from Union Square.
77	5	Great hotel in the middle of everything San Francisco. I walked to world class dining and shopping. A couple of blocks from Chinatown and around the corner was the cable car, municipal buses, and the BART. I parked my car with the valet and didn't use it again until I checked out.The staff was genuine, friendly, and helpful. Sitting in the lobby with coffee and the morning paper was a joy.I want to know how and why the hotel smells like cookies, except in my room, which smelled fresh and clean.It was fun and restful, a hard combination to achieve.
78	4	Good location. Excellent staff. The customer service is the reason to stay here. The restaurant doesn't serve breakfast, which was a draw back. But there are several good breakfast places in the area.Hello C4063RCerikag, thank you for staying at the Hotel Abri and for giving us a 4 star rating. We appreciate your time to write about your stay with us and hope that you will visit us again in the near future. Stay vibrant!
79	5	For San Francisco prices, the Hotel Abri was excellent....friendly people, clean and nicely appointed rooms with an EXCELLENT location. Lots of entertainment and restaurants in walking distance. I recommend this hotel without reservation.
80	4	The hotel was nice and it was in a great location. Our room experienced a little outside noise due to the restaurant below, but the hotel staff was very apologetic. The train station and trolley is right around the corner. They don't give very good written directions if you want them, they tell you where something is and you just hope you don't forget what they said. Overall, very happy with our stay.Dear Shoney75,Thank you very much for your valuable feedback. I am thrilled that you had an enjoyable stay with us. We are always excited and eager to make recommendations for guests when exploring the city, but I do apologize for the lack of written directions throughout your excursions. I have shared your experience with our staff and we will make sure to be as thorough as possible in the future. We hope to welcome you back to the Hotel Abri when your travels return you to the vibrant city of San Francisco!Yours in hospitality,Rob Brehant, General Manager, on behalf of the entire Abri Team
81	4	Loud street noise wasn't quite drowned out by the droning AC unit. Good thing I sleep like the dead or I would have been dead tired. Maid service was excellent staff very friendly and helpful. Convenient location.
82	5	You just walk out and experience San Fransisco. Loved the hospitality of the staff.Especially the younger guy (sorry, forgot your name). Very interested in his guests and tries to transpose in situations. If you read this, hope you still love the love the house and techno music :)
83	5	Hotel Abri is a clean, cute, boutique hotel with a great location. I've stayed at over 5+ hotels in the area and this had by far the best staff. They were friendly, attentive, and very helpful when I had questions. Unlike some of the larger hotels in SF, this one makes you feel at home and cared for. In terms of the most impressive of the staff, Kelly Nguyen stuck out and really went above and beyond. Thank you.
84	5	Abri is a very nice and modern hotel in an old building in the Heart of San Francisco. It is very tastefully decorated, clean and fresh. Interior rooms are quiet and will allow you a great nites sleep. Real HD TV, not just a big screen with SD TV. You wont be disappointed.
85	5	This is a great place to stay in SF downtown - close to everything, very nice hotel, helpful personnel. The room is a bit small but very modern, bathroom is really nice. Overall - great stay and value for money!
86	5	We have stayed at this hotel for three straight years. We in this case includes myself, my wife, and our 8 kids. The kids have ranged in ages from 1 year old up to 17 years old (depending on the stay) and we have loved it every time.We have stayed in a suite each year and at least one (sometimes two) other rooms. The suite with the adjoining room is great for our needs.The location is perfect. Right near the Bart, right in Union Square. Need a quick bite to eat for a picky kid Subway is next door. Want a quick ice cream for a kid (or adult) quickly Cold Stone right next door, as well. And of course you are within about a 3 minute walk of 100 other restaurants of 35 different types.Why do we keep coming back to the same hotel with all the other choices SERVICE! This place just gets it. They put an emphasis on service that is difficult to find. There may be hotels with more room or for better prices. But knowing that we will be treated exceptionally well and knowing the staff will help us out with any questions or needs is worth the extra few dollars. My only complaint is that the suite has bathroom doors of frosted glass so you can see the silhouette of the person standing in the bathroom or getting out of the shower. Not perfect for a family, and also the door is sliding, no locks. Made more for a couple than a family, so communication is important to avoid any issues. Still, more than worth the minor inconvenience with all this hotel offers.Hello Mark B,Thank you for taking the time to share your holiday experience with us. It is ALWAYS a pleasure to have you and your family celebrate the holidays with our family here at AbRi. I am happy to hear you enjoyed the delicious spots next door to us and all our nearby shopping areas. Thank you kindly for your detailed feedback as every review helps us on our stride for perfection.As we say here at Hotel AbRi, stay vibrant!Warmest Regards,Daniel Novelly Front Office Manager
87	5	We had a wonderful experience at Hotel Abri. From the moment we arrived, staff were warm, welcoming, professional, and helpful. The hotel is older but the rooms are updated and renovated. The hotel has great incentive programs (Green for Green). We had a few special requests that were easily accommodated. Great value, great location, great staff!! High recommend.Greetings hayjhamilton, thank you for giving us a 5 star rating. We are happy to know that your stay with us was a 5 star experience. please come and see us again in the near future. Stay vibrant!
88	5	Thank you for making my trip to San Francisco for a conference enjoyable. The room was so quiet. It was smaller than most hotel rooms I have stayed in but that made it more cozy. I was able to open the window for air. Everything was clean. The hotel staff were always pleasant and greeted me whenever our paths crossed. Thanks for the gifts just because I did not require maid service.
89	4	Okay experience but disappointed that I had a room next to constant construction. Also disappointed in the fact that I thought I was getting l'occitane products as well. Room was good and bed was comfortable. Hi laurenbX4703AO,I apologize that construction outside is constant during your stay. I suggest one of our interior rooms the next time you stay with us to accommodate a much more quieter stay. We hope that you give us another opportunity in the future!Stay Vibrant!Chris de Jesus
90	4	Enjoyed staying here. The staff was great (very attentive helpful) the rooms were clean. The rooms were small though. I enjoyed eating at the on-site restaurant. The food bar services were great!
91	5	In a city not known for sumptuous hotels, the St Regis is the local maximum. We stayed in a large, well-appointed suite with a nice view. We were somewhat disappointed by the fact that rooms are on the lower half of the bldg, as the upper half is reserved for residents. The result is that the W just down the street, while not of the same caliber, has infinitely better views. So, ask for floors 14-20. Below that, it s just too low.Second point of criticism - and this applies to all St Regis butlers: they creep us out! These guys need to be less awkward / better trained / older than 15. Now, for the good stuff: Nice pool area, very good spa treatments, and a rather hopping and pleasant lobby bar. The Japanese restaurant was also rather on the nice side. The location is obviously fantastic, with SF Moma half a block away, and all the shops a couple of blocks away.Overall, a relaxing St Regis - not their best hotel, but definitely the best in San Francisco.
92	5	Of the ten or so hotels I've stayed in in San Fran, the St. Regis is my favorite. Great location, lovely lobby and bar, and sleek modern rooms. Restaurants always left something to be desired, but looks as though a new one just opened. The service is top notch and the concierge is stellar. Sadly, like everything else in SF, the rates have gone up significantly so I don't get to stay there as often.Dear sncwalsh,Thank you for sharing your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I am pleased to hear that we continue to be your favorite hotel in San Francisco, and sincerely appreciate your kind words regarding our staff and service. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next visit, as we hope to welcome you back to the Best Address soon.Sincerely, Anthony Duggan Hotel Manager 415-284-4057 anthony.dugganstregis.com
93	5	My husband and I stayed at the St. Regis for six nights while visiting San Francisco. I spent a great deal of time selecting the hotel for this trip. After researching and considering many hotels, I chose the St. Regis. I was very happy with my choice. The location was great - it was close enough to every place we wanted to visit, without being in the middle of too much of the touristy crowd. Although our room didn't have the floor to ceiling windows I was expecting, it was nicely equipped and well maintained. I can overlook my disappointment over the absence of a panoramic view because of the amazing service. From the time we made our reservations to the time we left the hotel, the service was attentive and thoughtful, without being obtrusive. The concierge and guest relations people helped us with our wine tour, ferry and restaurant plans. The people at the front desk and in the lobby greeted us by name. Those at the restaurant, the Vitrine, were particularly kind and thoughtful. Kane was our server on most mornings. When he found out it was my birthday, he brought me a special breakfast dessert. To celebrate our anniversary, he brought us champagne and chocolate. The service made it truly a memorable stay. I'm sure that the service at the St. Regis will become the standard by which we will measure other hotels.Dear Kingtrips,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I pleased to hear that you and your husband had an exceptional experience and I sincerely appreciate your kind words regarding our service and your high recommendation of our hotel. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next visit to San Francisco, as we hope to welcome back to the best address soon.Sincerely,Anthony DugganHotel Manager415-284-4057anthony.dugganstregis.com
94	3	5 years ago it was a much better option ,they still charge high prices and have not nvested much .Definetely need refurbishment and / or they should be charging much lower .Attitude of reception is unacceptable , some of the consierge is OK , other services ( vale - breakfast... ) is not in accordence with 5 star hotel !!!Dear Vedat A,Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I regret to hear that you had a disappointing experience at our hotel, and sincerely apologize on behalf of our team for falling below our five star standard. I encourage you to contact me directly to further discuss the details of your stay and how we may improve our service and facilities. Sincerely, Anthony DugganHotel Manager415-284-4057anthony.dugganstregis.com
95	5	I'm a gold Starwood member and membership definitely has its perks. One place where you can definitely take advantage of great opportunities is the St. Regis in San Francisco. I've never had a less than stellar experience here. Stay in an Executive Premier guest room. Terrific value, space, design and comfort. Opt for the butler service -- always spot on and an amazing asset during your stay, from wake up service to the little touches, they anticipate your needs - the butler service is one of the hallmarks of the St. Regis experience. Gin and tonic Why yes, please.I stay at the St. Regis when I have friends in from out of town or when I just need a few days of aaaahhh time or when I'm returning from a long haul flight. I'm never disappointed. Ever. If you have the chance and the budget, do yourself a favor and stay at this truly world-class hotel.
96	5	The staff were great. Christian at the front desk was terrific and truly offered a luxury experience. Housekeeping staff did a great job and were nice enough to run my wife's bath prior to returning to the hotel (several times, sorry). Private dining breakfast was not the best but again the attendant was very accommodating. We didn't have a chance to experience the spa and pool. Only negative feedback would be that the windows were not soundproof. Overall a very pleasant stay and would return.
97	5	This hotel by far is the best hotel to stay for couple or business trip. It's super clean and nice. The staffs are extremely helpful and friendly. I definitely will stay here again for future business trips!Dear 850bond007,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. We sincerely appreciate your high recommendation of our hotel and look forward to welcome you back to the Best Address in the near future.Sincerely,Anthony DugganHotel Manager415-284-4057anthony.dugganstregis.com
98	5	Have spent five nights in this nice hotel perfectly located , only couple of minutes from Union Square.We had two connecting rooms accomodating five of us, both perfectly decorated , very spacious and well maintained. Staff is extremly friendly and willing to help. With my youngest daughter have also used pool which is quite largem, clean and not crowded. Only complaint is cost of in room wi-fi access (this kind of hotel should have it complimentary) as well as breakfast arrangements - although waitress are helpfull and polite - 20 minutes to get eggs and croissiants is not acceptable (and also quote expensive)Dear Guest,We would like to thank you for taking the time to review The St. Regis San Francisco. We are pleased to hear that you and your family had a wonderful stay with us and enjoyed our room dcor and hotel amenities. I apologize for the delay in your breakfast service and appreciate your comments regarding the in room wi-fi. I encourage you to contact me directly so that we may discuss the details of your stay and how we may improve your experience.Sincerely,William FongHotel Manager415-284-4057
99	4	We stayed there for 2 nights and staff were very friendly and helpful. It was in a great location and quite central to restaurants and cafe's. bed was comfy and bathroom was nice and clean. I would go back again if visiting San Francisco.Dear Julie M,We certainly appreciate that you took the time to share your review about your recent stay with us and the Trip Advisor community. We are pleased that you enjoyed our accommodations and service! We hope to welcome you back on your next trip to San Francisco, thanks again!Best regards,Haiyi Hotels Worldwide
100	5	Great location, close to Union Square and bus routes but not right in the middle of all the noise. Convenient grocery stores and coffee shops nearby. The front desk staff was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. We arrived early and they were quick to arrange an early check-in for us. The rooms are modern and well-appointed. The lobby is bright and comfortable. We were so pleased with our stay. This is a great value in the city!!!
101	5	Spent 3 nights at the Vertigo and can't really find anything to complain about check in was quick easy and friendly, our room on floor 7 was clean, big enough for us and fairly quiet other than an italian couple who deemed it acceptable at 7am to laugh and chat at the top of their voices! Walls are quite thin Used gym which was good for a hotel this size decent coffee in room and downstairs, good location for union sq and other neighbourhoods all In all a pleasant stayDear DJH1973,Thank you so much for your 5 star review - I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you did not let the loud couple affect your wonderful stay at the Hotel Vertigo. We look forward to having you again as our guest!Warm regards,Jaime GonzalezFront Office ManagerHotel Vertigo
102	4	Great value for the money and good location to explore SF. Beds are very comfortable and rooms are clean and good size. Only complaints about the room are lack of a comfortable chair and the dresser. The dresser is in the closet and is difficult to access which is annoying during a long stay. There is no exercise room (supposed to be coming) and no business center or conference room ( also supposed to be coming).Would stay again, but just aware of limitations.
103	4	1st time we went to this hotel in SF. I was a little cautious with low expectations due to the decent deal i got online with them. Only good surprises: Very nice staff, used to deal with international visitors and making the effort to speak other languages. Rooms are a little small but their design is tasteful. We had a comfortable bed, enjoyed a quiet sleep with almost no noise. If the hotel does not provide breakfast other than Coffee or tea, there' s a chinese 'diner' type at the next corner that will fulfill your needs for cheap.I ll go back there for my next trip in SFDear NicoCT,Thank you so much for offering your comments. I do appreciate you taking the time to recognize our staff, the great deal you found online and to our convenient location. We hope your travels lead you back to San Francisco sometime soon.Best regardsLuis MoralesHotel Manager
104	5	Location is fabulous, we walked everywhere as it was so central to where we wanted to go. Rooms were clean and staff extremely helpful - it was our first time in San Francisco and they sorted us with eating advice, cheap hop on bus tickets...Special mention to Cynthia, Ayala and Greg on reception who were great!
105	4	The hotel has a certain charm all its own. Although the Vertigo has no restaurant , there were plenty of places nearby to choose from. It was cheap, clean and had free Wi Fi. The staff was courteous and helpful. The rooms did lack adequate drawer space and were a little small. The bathroom was cool- I liked the rainhead shower and the H20 products and the flat panel TV. I would still recommend The Vertigo to anyone wanting a inexpensive place to stay with personality.
106	4	We needed one night in Seward before boarding a boat the next morning into Kenai Fjords National Park. Was choosing between the Best Western and the Holiday Inn. The location of the hotel is downtown, right across the street from the Sea Life Center, very close to Hotel Seward, and there are several restaurants within walking distance including Zudy's which...

107	4	We were there in winter so there was nothing happening outside. The casino had adequate slots but not much in the way of table games. We did quite well on penny slots......for a change. The front desk lady was very nice and accommodating, but we were early and had to wait for our room...our fault. The room was very large... More
108	5	You won't regret your stay here. Beautiful scene, amazing area, and personalized stay. They even have cookies in the lobby! I love the bungalows that sit behind the hotel, it feels like your own cabin!
109	5	My husband and I arrived at this hotel, and knew we were booked for a room with a partial view. When we arrived, before we saw our room, we decided to ask if there was another room with a total view. At the registration desk,...More

111	5	Excellent, would definitely stay here again , even though we arrived early we were made to feel very welcome . The room was very comfortable, the Jacuzzi, swimming pool ( heated ) and sauna were superb.
112	3	The rooms were functional but not of the W quality I'd expect. I'm a SPG gold member and was treated nicely and had complimentary drinks but I doubt I'd stay at this property again. its close to the trains and is walkable to pike market but that's all I can say for the hotel. They need any/better art work on the walls. A little texture could help too. I'm not an interior designer or anything close but I know I can do better.Hello KevnLA310, Thank you so much for your response on your recent experience at W Seattle. Our apologies that it wasn't the experience that you had hoped it would be. We do appreciate all of the constructive feedback, as we are always looking for more ways to make our guests' experience more enjoyable.
113	4	The same feel and vibe of other W hotels though lighting in room was better than others I have been in. Love the Bliss products. Didn't try the bar or restaurant this time but have in the past. Was decent.Hello Debra R, thank you for your review of your recent stay at W Seattle. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay. Our team works hard at making sure our guests have a great experience here, so all feedback is incredibly important to us. Thanks again and we hope to welcome you back next time you are in the city.
114	5	Even though I've worked for a W property in the past, I had never stayed in one as a guest so I was super excited when we had enough points saved up for a 2 night stay at the W Seattle for our 1st anniversary. Upon arrival, Nina (super sweet and friendly) assisted us and let us know that our room was not ready yet so they stored our luggage and said they would email us when it was ready. We never received an email but headed back around 4pm and it was ready. They had defeathered the room per our SPG profile and even upgraded us to a Cool Corner Room. I was so excited! Their W Insider (concierge) had emailed us prior to the trip and asked if we were celebrating anything special. We told them it was our anniversary and he was able to upgrade us as a surprise. Along with the upgrade, was a bottle of champagne on ice and some homemade gummy bears which totally put a smile on our faces. That's hospitality at its finest. The room was super clean and the view was amazing with 4 large windows. The room also had a really nice chaise lounge that couple be separated into 2 seats or combined for 1 lounge. It was really comfy. The W mattress is also really comfy and I liked that the bed was lower to the ground. The AC was also really quiet which provided us 2 nights of really good sleep. In the evenings, they had live music in the Living Room and after 9pm they had a DJ so it was sort of a party atmosphere at night but no noise could be heard from the room aside from city street noise. Overall, we had a great experience. The staff always greeted us when we walked by and the valet guys always opened the doors for us. I hope to visit again soon!PS- it's a 6 block walk to Pike Place Market. No need to rent a car as everything was within walking distance. WOW, thank you for sharing about your recent visit 882triciam, we appreciate the opportunity to be part of such a special event! It sounds like you were able to take advantage of our location to check-out everything Seattle has to offer, including some live local music in the Living Room. The team works hard to make sure our guests every need is met and I'll be sure to share this with them.
115	3	We'd stayed in this hotel about ten years ago, when it was very hip happening. Now, not so much. Still, the room was fine, the bedding good, and the cleanliness what you'd expect for a higher end hotel. Not sure what's up with the very loud air conditioning, though. Even on its lowest fan setting, the noise level was so high that my husband and I had to raise our voices to be heard. Overall, an okay experience in a hotel that used to be much more than okay.Hello,Thank you very much for your feedback. I am really sorry about your experience with the Air Conditioning in your room. Warmest regards,Nadia
116	4	I found this hotel quite comfortable to stay at. Business conditions required that I work overnight and sleep during the day, and the blackout curtain was quite effective at keeping out light. I almost never heard any noise from other rooms or the hallway either, and city noise was nonexistent away from the window (except for the occasional siren). Hotel staff was very helpful with any requests. The exercise room has a lot of equipment for workouts. The bed was very comfortable. Room service is a bit pricey.Hello Daniel S, many thanks for your great review on your recent stay at W Seattle. It sounds like you were BUSY while here! I am thrilled to hear that you enjoyed the black out shade as well as the room stayed nice and quiet for you to get some rest! We do look forward to welcoming you back next time you are in the city. Thanks again!
117	4	Hotel is very clean, beautiful and in perfect location. Love that you can walk everywhere but overnight parking is a bit pricing. I requested a view of Elliott Bay and pay a little extra to get the higher floor for the view, it was disappointing - NO VIEW! Overall the stay was comfortable and love the cleanliness of this hotel!
118	5	Can't go wrong with this hotel. Beautiful rooms and super close to all activity around town. It's situated on 8th street, so a leisurely walk down to 1st takes you to the Pike St markets. Hertz rental car is also based in the car park of the building, so really convenient if you want to drop off or pick up a rental. Staff all really helpful and really pleasant. We had a great stay.Thank you for your notes. We love that our central downtown location allows our guests to easily get to great restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. Please come back and see us on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
119	5	Checked in the day before leaving on an Alaskan cruise. Had nothing but a grand experience. The hotel is a couple of small blocks away from the monorail that goes to the Space Needle and other attractions. Our room was clean, reasonable size, huge bathroom. Even though we were close to the elevators, the rooms were very quiet. Would definitely stay there again + was a really good rate, several dollars cheaper than near the pier. No complaints!
120	5	Without a doubt this hotel is beautiful, immaculate and the staff is very courteous. I would expect no less of a hotel of this caliber. What blew me away was their friendliness and hospitality toward our one year old baby boy. When they found out we were traveling with a baby we were placed in a beautiful corner room with a separate area for our son to sleep. Anyone traveling with babies will understand how valuable this is! You can hear the traffic noise on the street below but we traveled with a white noise machine that blocked the noise. We requested a travel crib and they delivered the crib already assembled with extra towels and wash cloths and a set of travel size Johnson and Johnson bath products. These little touches made this mama's heart so happy! I would give more than 5 stars if possible.
121	5	We were given a beautiful room overlooking Pike's Market and the Bay. Nice size rooms and wonderful bathroom. Staff was welcoming and remembered our names as we went in and out of hotel. Well located for all public transportation and restaurants. In the middle of all the best shopping. Walked everywhere or took public transportation wherever we needed to go.Thank you for taking the time to review the Grand Hyatt Seattle. Our hotel is perfect for the recreation or business travel and is conveniently located to public transportation and many Seattle attractions. I am pleased to hear that our location, guest rooms and friendly staff made your stay enjoyable. Lindye W.Guest Relations Manager
122	5	Have stayed at over 30 Hyatt properties, this one was among the best I have seen. Exceptional property, exceptional service. Really went out of their way to make us feel welcome and appreciated. Would definitely recommend.
123	5	Recent trip to Seattle and stay at Grand Hyatt were great. The hotel is clean and the staff were all very welcoming. The location of the hotel could not have been better. The convention center is close by and shopping is right outside the door. It is within walking distance to the Pike Place Fish MarketThank you for the review on your stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We pride ourselves on providing the best customer service and we are pleased to hear that you encountered this during your stay! We are located just a few blocks from some major attractions, but we are very close to public transportation as well as great shops and restaurants. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future.Brenna N.Guest Relations Manager
124	5	Seattle has so many great hotels it was hard to choose. We only sayed one night prior to our Alaskan cruise, and it exceeded expectations. Beautiful, clean, marble bathroom with soaking tub, great toiletries. Comfy, clean bed, great service. Decent view of the city. PERFECT location. The whole experience was a pleasure and we will return.Thank you for the review and compliments for the Grand Hyatt Seattle! I truly hope you will be able to come back to Seattle and spend more time with us. We look forward to your next stay.Lindye W.Guest Relations Manager
125	5	The Grand Hyatt in downtown Seattle offers an extremely comfortable a spacious room, with a nice view from the upper floors that face west. The bathroom is large, with extremely nice shower and bathtub. The room is quiet and well insulated from sounds from other rooms, although you emergency vehicles driving can be strangely loud. You can open a small window to get some fresh air too.Thank you for your note. We love that you were able to relax and feel accommodated. Our goal is always to make our guests feel welcomed and comfortable. We hope to see you again on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
126	5	This is a great hotel right where you want to be in Seattle close to everything transportation outlets malls very nice would recommend it to anyone clean safe I felt right at home and I will be back loved the service of the hotel
127	5	This hotel has what it takes to enjoy a Seattle exploration. It is surrounded by every area one must visit within a city that has so many facets to admire. The property has all of the amenities...a Starbucks, a steak house, a deli, a sushi bar, and a great fitness center to work them off. We walked everywhere with ease, and watched the world from a panoramic view from our picture frame window. To say that we were pleasantly surprised would, well, cover it....Thank you for your comments. We love that our central downtown location makes it easy for our guests to explore all that our great city has to offer. It's also great that we can offer all you might need without even leaving the hotel. We would love to have you back with us on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
128	5	Every aspect of my stay was wonderful. The staff was friendly, polite, professional, and genuinely caring towards their guests. Food provided at the conference was delicious and healthy with tons of options. The room was super clean, comfortable, and luxurious. Thank you for such an amazing stay at your hotel!! I hope to be back again soon!
129	5	7 blocks from downtown. Easy walking to many spots. Pike's Place, Original Starbuck's, space needle, underground etc. 15 floor view of the water. Ruth Chris restaurant inside hotel. Smaller gym, but all I needed. Staff was very helpful. Easy check in and checkout.
130	5	My first time visiting the city, and I am so glad I chose this hotel. I was in town for a marathon the city was hosting. I arrived a few days early so that I could tour the city as well as rest a bit. As with any walking friendly city, location is so important. Trust me, It was centrally located. In one day, I walked to the CenturyLink Field event center for the expo, visited the market, the needle, and hopped aboard a ferry. Upon my return, I had the choice of a relaxing bath in a spacious tub or a quick shower. Definitely after the marathon, that tub came in handy!!! I was able to sleep comfortably every night which was very important for my mindset. Every evening I would return to a clean room with everything I had requested. Housekeeping was very attentive. Also, there's a Starbucks inside the hotel as well as a place that makes hot sandwiches which came in very handy for my last minute carb fix. If ever in Seattle again, I'm staying here!!Thank you for your comments. We're so happy that you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of all the amenities to prep and decompress from your marathon. It's wonderful that you were also able to explore the city and even get on the water while you were here! We would love to have you back with us during your next visit to Seattle.Best Regards,Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
131	5	Hotel has a nice lobby and check-in was nice and quick. Had a morning flight in and got to the hotel by 12 PM. They had my room ready and they were able to accommodate my request to be on the same floor as my brother's room. The room itself was just right for a family of four and the bathroom was a very nice size to accommodate the girl's toiletries and the boy's minimal essentials. Bathroom had tub separate from a nice size shower stall. As for the hotel location, only a block away from Pacific Place mall which had restaurants and a movie theater. The hotel was also only 7 blocks away from Pike Place Market which we practically went to every day. Very convenient to public transportation to and from airport as well as to the Space Needle. Definitely would stay in this hotel again if the opportunity arises.
132	4	Staying here puts you within walking distance to most of the places you might want to visit in downtown Seattle. It's cheaper to park yourself in the garage than to use valet parking. Check-in was quick and friendly. Our room was very nice and well-appointed. There is a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse on site and other good restaurants close by and a Starbucks off the lobby. We would love to stay here again.
133	5	I used to stay at The W hotel in Seattle but now stay at this Hyatt. Beautiful rooms, great decor, some sides of the building do have a water view, great location, easy to walk down to the Pike Market, excellent shopping and sightseeing.My only compliant was the Asian gentleman working the front desk who refused to print my boarding passes after the printer on the self serve Boarding Pass Kiosk failed, I politely asked the other Gentleman working at the front desk and he immediately printed the boarding passes for us.Excellent Property for Business or TouristHighly Recommended
134	4	My wife and I stayed here for a night in February 2015 to meet up with family from England and we were very impressed with the rooms and service provided. The hotel is in an ideal downtown location which means that you can walk to all the nearby restaurants and attractions.
135	5	Fourth of July is a time to hit the road and with 90-100 degree temps in Chicago, I went West for the cooler air of Seattle. When I was hotel shopping I saw that the Grand Hyatt's rates were identical to many others in the area, so I decided to jump in with them. After I booked, it gave me an option to try to upgrade to a suite for 39, so, I said What the hell! and went for it.After, arriving in Seattle and taking the rail line to downtown, I emerged and walked 2 blocks to the Grand Hyatt. The lobby was quiet, intimate and spacious. Cassie welcomed me and began to check me in. She confirmed she upgraded me to the Emerald suite and told me I really gotten a good deal! I hope so, I though to my self. I ended up on the top floor with an amazing view of the sound, as well as much of downtown.The suite was awesome. It is hard to describe such an amazing room, with the view and all. It just sort of takes your breath away for a minute and you just soak it all in. None of the pictures here do this property justice. If you like what you see, you will be even more impressed when you are there. The suite did not even look like a hotel room, but rather some nice apartment I only wish I could afford. There were plenty of knick knacks, art, books, etc, all over. The Grand bed was - well, grand! You almost never want to get out of it. The linens were amazing, the bath stocked with every essential. Even a separate bath gel in case a bubble bath was in order (which it was one night). With more than enough room for two, several additional people could easily fit it with out any problems. Everything was neat, clean, comfortable, and housekeeping did an amazing job each day!The real gem of the hotel with Grand Club on 27. Although, not a lot of snacks, there were free sodas and juice all throughout the day. Tom, our host in the evening is the jewel holding the crown together! Beyond friendly, fun, and always on top of everything, he genuinely seemed to care! He remembered several guests drink choices from night to night (He certainly remembered mine, and I saw him acknowledge and recognize others). This level of personal attention is what sets this place apart from the rest.Watching the game on TV in the lounge, sipping a cocktail and munching on some cheese and veggies, I was quite happy. Tom seemed able to converse with kids and adults alike. Making his guests smile and happy seems to come naturally for him. Also a wealth of information on places to go, and the best way to get there, it was like having a live Google to chat with!The location of this hotel means that you really do not need a car. You can walk just about any where or a short cab ride at most. Save your money - forgo the car (and parking) and enjoy this city. There is a Starbucks and Deli in the lobby and several other Starbucks within a few blocks, so access to coffee and food are not a worry. Plenty of shopping and all the great attractions (Pike Place, Space Needle, etc) nearby!I would certainly stay here again - even if it cost a little bit more! Pamper yourself - relax and enjoy Seattle from the Grand Hyatt - it will be a a Grand Memory for sure!I appreciate you taking the time to give feedback on all the aspects of your stay with us at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. I am thrilled to hear that you chose us to spend your Fourth of July holiday with and that you were able to experience all that our hotel has to offer. Our suites are spacious and equipped with everything you need so I was glad to hear how comfortable you were. As well, I will certainly pass along the compliments to Cassie and Tom - they are truly a valuable part of our team. We look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel!Lindye W. Guest Relations Manager
136	5	We just stayed here our second time and it is officially our go to hotel when in Seattle. I expect friendly service, clean room, good location, etc., and I got it all at a high level. The rooms are well designed--large shower, comfortable sized space in room, mini fridge, good bed. All employees are very welcoming. The Club is also a great option.
137	1	I called there asking to speak to my husband in the room in which he was staying. I gave the first and last name. I had failed to ask my husband for the room number...however due to the fact that I was not staying there and never been asked that before by any other hotel I was a little confused.... More
138	5	This hotel and its people are always great. We always come back to this location even though there are many alternatives in the Greenville area. The location is perfect. From here there is no need for your car. You can walk everywhere easily.
139	1	The hotel looks good, and I don't know if things have gotten bad lately, but when we stayed there it was noisy as heck and the place is run by kids. We stayed AT FIRST (but not for long) on the first floor. Whatever was going on above us sounded like a wrestling match. It was there when we checked... More
140	4	We are Hilton honors members and love the consistent accommodations, the staff was friendly. Our room was lovely, but due to a soccer tournament it was full of young boys who were running in the halls and kicking soccer balls. Not the hotels fault, but we were surprised at the noise level.
141	4	Unexpectedly needed a hotel near Harrisburg, Va. Stumbled upon the Quality Inn in Carlisle, on Harrisburg Pike, just 0.5 mile from I-81. Our room was spacious, well appointed and clean. The pool area (also well maintained and inviting) had music playing. But best of all was Debra, the registration clerk, who made us feel welsome, and went out of her... More
142	3	If you're you're looking for a nice place to sleep after a long drive or if you're a local looking for some peace quiet this is the perfect place. It's right off the exit, surrounded by additional hotels, restaurants and a Tarjay (Target). I was over near Lenox mall and I drove 20 minutes away to this hotel because... More
143	5	We just returned from a three night stay at this hotel. We loved it. Public transportation is right out the front door (bus and streetcar). If you'd rather walk, just head strait down Carondelet - it turns into Bourbon when you cross Canal (6 blocks).Hot breakfast is provided every morning in the lobby. On Sun-Thur, each adult guest receives three complimentary evening cocktails in the lobby.The rooftop pool is small, as is the fitness center.The lobby is beautiful, with marble floors and nice chandeliers. We stayed in a king suite, and it had tons of space, although the bathroom area seemed small. Our teenaged nephew slept on the pull-out sofa, and appreciated all the room he had to spread out. He also appreciated that we had our own tv in the bedroom, so he could have control over the one in the living room. He loved the free internet access, but didn't love the TONS of pop-up ads that came along with it.The king suite had:One bedroom with king bed, two night stands with lamps, entertainment center with television, telephone, and closet. Living area with pull-out sofa, chair, recliner, coffee table, entertainment center with television, refrigerator, and microwave (2 free soft drinks and microwave popcorn provided), and desk area with internet access.The vanity area had another closet, as well as a coffee maker. Parking is 13 a day, which is a bargain. The lot is self-park, no valet, so you have access to your car whenever you need it.Make sure your room key is always handy. You need it to get in and out of the parking area, to use the elevators, and to get into the back entrance (all day) or the lobby entrance (after hours).This was our third trip to New Orleans, and our first stay at the Drury. I think we'll stay here again.
144	5	Hotel is great and will stay here again! Located in the business district.Cab ride from airport for 3people is a flat 15pp. 2 people is 36.Day manager Kyle was fantastic and always made time to ask about our day.All staff was friendly and very nice.Free breakfast was very plentiful and decent choices.Evening free buffet was also plentiful plus you get 3 free drinks!Pool was nice and hot tub was large. 2 washers and dryers near the pool area.Beds were very comfortable and rooms were a good size.We had 2 queen beds, desk with business chair and a sitting chair.Our room also had a mini fridge and small microwave.Elevators will only work with a room key so that was nice for security.Located about 4blocks from French quarter it is a straight walk to bourbon street.St. Charles trolly stop just across the street that heads towards the French quarter so you don't have to walk if you don't want to.Cab ride back from French quarter was anywhere from 5 to 10My only drawback would be our room did not have a safe but other than that had no issues whatsoever and will look to stay in a Drury Inn again if it's in a city we are traveling to.
145	5	This location, like all Drury locations, exceeds all expectations for a lower cost, quality hotel. If Drury has a location in the city I am traveling to, I know where I will stay!Rooftop pool was very nice, rooms (2) were quiet and clean, service exceptional as always. We were in New Orleans for two nights after a cruise. Close to all attractions (walking distance to Bourbon street) and on the Trolly Line. If we return to NOLA, we will come back to Drury.
146	3	We come to New Orleans multiple times a year. We normally stay at another chain of hotels but our normal arrangements were booked full. This is our first time at this particular hotel and staying with this chain. The positives are this hotel is nice, very updated, we found our 2 bedroom suite to be very spacious, very clean, and the offerings for the food choices of the happy hour and breakfast exceeded our expectations. The front desk staff were very kind and helpful. They even assisted me to book needed activities for our family. The negatives are this establishment is ran so tightly it is at the expense of the comfort of its customers. The happy hour requires you to keep up with a card per adult to ensure you receive no more than 3 beverages. The happy hour offerings are of course well drinks and cheap wine. My husband accidentally spilled his last glass of wine at the bar and the employee made mention he was exceeding the allowable amount of beverage as he begrudgingly replaced it. The air conditioner is fixed to not go below 70 F. Our entire family was extremely uncomfortable and sweated all night. The tubs are fixed to only allow showers. There are not individual toiletries. Instead there is a shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser attached to the wall. It kind of grossed me out to think every other naked person before had touched it during their shower. They do advertise to earn so many reward points for everyday you do not utilize housekeeping so that leads me to believe this is a brand/chain initiative. It's a nice hotel that is uncomfortable and that's just unfortunate. My husband's review was, It's like being a guest of a cheapskate.
147	5	Our family of 3 stayed here for 4 nights in late December. The whole experience from arrival to departure was enjoyable. We arrived at the hotel before lunchtime, and were pleasantly surprised to be able to go straight up to our room. The young woman who checked us in (Jamie) was so welcoming and friendly, we felt at home instantly. She even gave us a great recommendation for lunch, which we took, and enjoyed. Our room was on the 6th floor. It was large and well set out. We had 2 comfortable double beds , an armchair, desk, large screen TV, fridge, coffee maker and toiletries. The included breakfast was plentiful. Not a huge choice, but we always found something we enjoyed. It was busy during our stay so some mornings it was hard to find anywhere to sit, but one thing I will mention is the manager(s) were always making sure tables were cleaned briskly, so the wait was never too long. I found seeing management level doing this task and mingling with the people staying at the hotel a really nice touch. They always made time to ask about your day, and seemed to genuinely be interested in what you had to say. The nightly 'kickback' was another nice touch. We usually just had a nibble on the chips or popcorn,as had already eaten enough during the day, but it was fun to meet fellow holiday makers and hear about where they were from, or ideas of what to do around New Orleans. All in all I can not fault this hotel at all. Well done Drury Inn New Orleans for a efficiently run hotel with welcoming and friendly staff. Keep up the great work.
148	4	The Drury Inn and Suites in the Central Business District, New Orleans is close to everything, a few minutes walk you are in the French Quarter or at the Superdome. Surrounded by restaurants and bars it makes it convenient for short or long term stays. The staff makes you feel right at home from the minute you walk in and the evening social is a great time to meet new people while enjoying the free perks the hotel offers.
149	4	We stayed one night and were pleased. The staff was friendly and the room was clean. Not only was a full, hot breakfast included but happy hour offered hotdogs, tacos, baked potatoes, soup and 3 free cocktails per person. Nothing fancy but everything you need.
150	5	Absolutely loved this hotel. Located in a quiet area 5 blocks west of Canal and Bourbon streets. Free all you can eat hot breakfast in the morning. Hors d'oeuvres served in the evening along with 3 free alcoholic drinks per person. However, if you do this, you lose the chance to sample all the great New Orleans restaurants. g But, if you are on a tight budget, this really helps to defray expenses.Trolley line is just across the street from the front door and it will get you to just about everywhere in the area.King size bed was comfortable with 5 pillows provided. Our room had a whirlpool bath. Front desk clerks are so pleasant and always smiling considering they seem to spend most of their time answering tourist questions. My thanks to Renaldo, Ayila and Star. I will definitely stay at this hotel next time I return. And I had so much fun in this city, I expect to return soon.OldTOm
151	5	This trip was just a one night stay for a concert with just my daughter and myself. We arrived around 4:30 in the afternoon. Check in was quick and the clerk was extremely friendly and helpful. I requested the highest floor and away from street traffic and both were granted. The hotel is really nice inside and was spotless. Our room was a double and it was extremely clean and roomy. The bathroom was really nice and the beds were comfortable. We had adequate towels for the two of us. Another plus for this hotel is the secured parking lot is adjacent to the building. I really don't think there was anything that I would say needed improvement there. Customer service was great throughout the stay. You have to use your roomkey to access the hotel after 10:00 PM. You also have to use the key to operate the elevators from the lobby and to open and close the gate so be sure to keep one of your room keys when you check out if you are driving or you will have to go back inside as I did to get a key to get your car out. The hotel is walking distance to Bourbon St and the Riverwalk area (In my opinion). It may be a little far if you have any mobility issues. It is only a 4 or 5 block walk to the Superdome or the New Orleans Arena. We will be staying here again in the future.
152	5	This Drury Inn is in the perfect location in New Orleans! Only blocks away from Bourbon St. Right by the parade routes for Mardi Gras, and even the superdome. The free breakfast, and 5:30 kickbacks just add to how great this hotel is. They just provide such a great deal with the atmosphere of the hotel, to the staff. Whenever I travel I try to only book a Drury Inn Suites hotel.
153	4	An overall excellent experience. The hotel staff was consistently friendly. Well situated to the French Quarter, Riverwalk, Harrah's and much more. The complimentary breakfast had a lot to offer - fresh fruit, waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage patties, yogurt were only some of the items available. There's also a complimentary happy hour with food, but we were out about. The rooms were nice - the beds suited us, there was a small refrig the shower was OK. An appreciated detail was that there are an abundant number of outlets throughout the room. If driving, it's not too far off the I-10 hotel parking is valet only.
154	5	My husband and I stayed at this hotel the weekend before Mardi Gras. I was a bit apprehensive because of some reviews but overall I was pleased. The staff was very nice and helpful. We left our room early in the morning and several days near noon and upon our return our room was nice and tidy. We had a jacuzzi suite and it was quite spacious...enough room for much more than two people. There are two full size closets, mini fridge, flat panel TV, livingroom, and separate bedroom. The short walk to the French Quarter was nice and there is a Domino's just around the corner for an evening snack...or there are many nicer places that deliver to the hotel. Maybe the only little thing that kind of bothered us was the view. I am not sure if all jacuzzie suites are situated in the back corner of the hotel but our view was faced west and consisted primarily of two brick walls bordering the parking lot and some buildings off in the distance. Since we didn't spend much time in our room, the view did not bother us much. It was our first trip to New Orleans for some of the Mardi Gras festivities and we look forward to staying here again in the future.
155	5	I traveled to New Orleans with my husband for a 3 night stay. This was our first trip here and we had a blast! The Drury Inn was the perfect place to stay! The breakfast was perfect, the free drinks/food at happy hour were a plus, and the staff couldn't have been more friendly!. Our room was very clean, bigger than I expected (just a standard room) and the bathroom had a marble look. The in-room fridge microwave was awesome. We utilized the pool every day and it was very quiet and refreshing. The fitness room contained 2 treadmills 1 bike and a flat screen tv. No weights, but at least there was a place to run off some fun from the night before! The location was a few short blocks to anything and everything! We always opted for the main streets, and never felt scared on any of our walks around town (even at 2am). We will stay here again the next time we visit for sure! Make sure to get a hand grenade at Tropical Isle. 3 will get the job done. Enjoy!!!!!
156	5	Great hotel. We did not meet one unfriendly staff member. Called asking for early check-in and they were happy to accommodate. Located in the center of the various NOLA districts - walking distance to French Quarter/Garden District/Warehouse District/etc. The hotel's Kickback Hour was better than anticipated. Every night there is salad bar/soups/chicken tenders/baked potato/etc. in addition to 3/night complimentary alcoholic drinks. The pool area was also very nice. Recommend this hotel all the way around! :)
157	5	I recently stayed at the Drury Inn for 3 nights. I was assigned a corner room on the 6th fl that had two exposures of Poydras street. I was very satisfied with the room. It was quiet (some minor street noise), very well appointed, had a nice whirlpool type jet tub, and the TV channel selection was decent. The room was clean and well cared for. The hotel was very nice, had some character, and was close to most of what people want to see when visiting New Orleans. However, it was a few blocks from most of those attractions, which I didnt mind, but someone who wants to be in the thick of the action might find it disappointing being in the business district where the hotel is. The walk to the waterfront or Bourbon Street was about 6 blocks and felt safe even at night. The free food and drink was a big plus. The breakfast offerings met all my expectations. Well-cooked scrambled eggs, waffles, bagels, etc. The afternoon happy hour selection was weaker. The hot dogs were consistently under cooked and somewhat unattractive in appearance. I would say beef was either non-existent or way down on the ingredients listing. The other foods were satisfactory, but nothing off the charts. Hey, but this was all free, so I cant subtract points. But if you plan on feasting your physician will take exception with your meal choices. In a general sense, based on observations at various times during my midweek visit, this hotel tends to attract a somewhat older crowd.say vacationing retirees. I only saw 1 child during my 3 day visit and limited people in their 40s or less. My only real issue with the hotel was the fitness center. It literally consisted of 2 treadmills and a bike. Nothing else. If a hotel advertises offering such an amenity, I dont think such a limited offering qualifies. While there was a sign up suggesting an improved offering will be forthcoming when the new hotel wing is complete, that didnt help me on my visit and I only consider hotels that offer such because I plan on using them. I wasnt able to here.All in all, I was satisfied with my stay despite the fitness center misrepresentation. I would not hesitate to select the Drury on a future stay.
158	5	We were pleased to find that our room was so large. Beds were very comfortable and the hotel itself was close to everything. We were able to walk everywhere. The breakfast selection was very good. The drinks and snacks in the early evening were a very pleasant surprise. I would not hesitate to stay in another Drury Hotel.
159	5	This was our first trip to New Orleans, so we had no experience with hotels in the city. We found the Drury Inn and Suites through reading reviews on TripAdvisor. The reviews were very helpful, and we are so glad that we stayed at the Drury. Our room was very nice, the bed comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. All the staff that we spoke to were very friendly and helpful. Wifi and breakfast are included in the price of the room as well as the 5:30 KIckback with three drinks per person and snacks. Another of the reasons that we chose this hotel based on the reviews on TripAdvisor was that the hotel is close enough to walk to the French Quarter and Canal Street, but far enough from the noise of Bourbon Street that you could actually get a good night's sleep. We were able to walk to the French Quarter for sightseeing and to the restaurants. The street cars to get to the Garden District or City Park are also within walking distance.We would definitely recommend the Drury Inn Suites to friends or family without hesitation and it would be our first choice as a hotel when we go back to New Orleans.
160	5	As usual number one place to stay. Love the friendly staff for the most part did have one cranky one in the drink part. Breakfast and dinner was good. Recommend Room 221. Where around the corner under the Corredor there is the elevator that takes it down to the lunch room And to the rooftop pool. Prices are comparable to the local area. Fridge and coffee in the room. About five blocks from Canel Street and into the French quarters. Walking distance which we did. But there is also a street car service available right outside of the corner lot
161	5	I commend the staff at Drury for achieving some of the highest quality customer service I've experienced. So often employees get jaded, bring their personal lives into work, and/or generally take out their personal problems with others at the workplace. The week we were there we enjoyed smiles and pleasantries every morning from the ladies at breakfast, Rosa (room attendant), and those working the desk. Not to leave out Jonathan, Jeremy, and Brandon, our Valet's. These guys were very pleasant and gave off a great spirit while taking care of our vehicle making sure it was always ready to roll, often on short notice. I witnessed them actually running to provide positive service for us and other guests. All in all everyone we came in contact with were great representatives for this company. I will continue to seek out Drury for our travels. I'm Wardog and I approve this message.
162	5	The room was great staff pleasant only 1 mile from French Quarter location great definetly would stay here again .The hotel had a good breakfast buffet and light snacks and refreshments in the mid afternoon and a light supper buffet 3 free alchol beverages a night and a 15 min long distance call a day home.
163	4	Spent a week here last year. From the moment we walked in to reception the staff couldn't be more helpful. Saw the manager everyday walking around talking to everyone. Usual American breakfast plenty of it, but not to my taste, but saying that I found it same at all the hotels we stayed in for the month we were touring around the southern states. Plenty of fresh fruit, toast, oatmeal which was fine for me. Good coffee and tea was ok when you used two tea bags!! Room was large and extremely comfortable, nice bathroom and very clean. Plenty of towels and toiletries and good quality. Loved the pool on the roof and the Managers Reception every evening was an added bonus and very much appreciated. Would stay there again if we ever come back to new Orleans.
164	4	We were only staying in NOLA for one night before our cruise and stayed at this hotel. It was very nice and secure. Your room key was also a means to get into the hotel after a certain point at night and to also use the elevator. (We've never experienced security quite like that before ).. the hotel is in a very nice part of NOLA, however...it's about 4 blocks from the French Quarter so it is quiet. I would definitely consider staying here again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet hotel that's not too far from all of the action.
165	5	I had a king bedroom suite in the back corner of the 5th floor. The room was perfect. The bathroom had a lot of space and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was delicious and the dinner in the afternoon was also very yummy. The staff was very friendly and polite despite it being hectic due to Mardi Gras going on. I didn't use the parking but the hotel having it's own garage is a plus. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking to not stay in the heart of the French Quarter.
166	5	I stayed at the Drury Inn checking in on July 4th and stayed 4 nights. This hotel is clean and well maintained. The people that work here ALL seem to be friendly and helpful. Check in was painless. I was able to check in early before noon. The breakfast is nice. They have more than the average hotel breakfast. Eggs, sausage, biscuits, Oatmeal, potatos, waffle makers along with the normal fruit, cold cereral, yogurt type items. The afternoon kick back food is nice. Hot dogs,, check tenders, etc. This hotel is perfect for a large family with lots of kids. You can save money with the free meals and drinks. The free drinks are nice, not a big selection alcohol wise. A few types of wine and beer, vodka, bloody marys, tonic water, orange juice is about the extent of the alcohol. Its free, so just go with the flow!! Popcorn and pop in the afternoon also. Our room was on the 8th floor facing Carondelet street and had a nice view. Not much street noise. Room had double beds and was nice. High ceilings and large windows. Comfy beds. No exhaust in the bathroom. Housekeeping met expectations. The hotel is on Poydras which is in the business district so you will have to walk to get to the action of Canal street and the French Quarter. French quarter was about 5 or 6 blocks straight up Carondelet. We walked it LATE at night/EARLY morning and had no problem. Didn't feel unsafe. Trolley car line is at the corner. Stadium is about 5 or 6 blocks up the street. They have 2 computers in the lobby with printers. I had no problems with them. Also an ATM. 3 ATM charge. Nice sitting area to relax in the lobby and downstairs. The location isn't THAT bad. If you want to see a lot, then there will be a lot of walking or trolley riding. Cabs are plentiful and the front desk will call you a cab which I recommend. Unless you are VERY picky, high class type and expect EVERY little thing to be perfect, just about anyone should like this hotel and be satisfied. Its not 5 star Sheraton fancy, but not a Motel 6.
167	4	The night staff was super nice when Ichecked in late on the evening. Ouickly the staff addressed my needs. The room was very clean. The breakfast was hot, well stocked and presented in a timely manner.
168	5	Very modern and welcoming hotel. This will be my go to hotel when traveling to the greater ATL area. Staff was helpful and the location was perfect. Loved how clean and inviting my room was. Thank you
169	5	A perfect spot to catch a 6:00 AM shuttle to the airport...wake-up call was very efficient....we ate dinner in their restaurant and it was good, not great...it's a hotel restaurant...There's an old adage, that if there is a line around a free-standing restaurant, The food must be Great...If there is a line at a hotel restaurant, the service must not be goodGood day mlesser1,Thank you for staying with us and sharing your comments. We're delighted you enjoyed your stay and the convenience of the airport shuttle service.We hope to welcome you again soon.Be well.
170	3	You will not find a friendlier, accommodating staff than at The Partridge Inn. I thought I had left a small gray bag in the room, which my boyfriend had unknowingly packed with his belongings, and Herman was very helpful. I cannot say one negative word in regards to the staff. They were superb. I would recommend this hotel for its... More
171	3	I come here every year, with my family. Used to be a great experience. Staff was always helpful. Not as good as it was for families, now you cant even have kids food in the lobby bar. Staff is not as welcoming as they used...More
172	4	There are two La Quintas in Westminster and I've stayed in both. This one is better: cleaner, friendlier, and generally better run. Now that I've stayed at this one, I won't be returning to the other.
173	2	We stay at LaQuinta's regularly. This one fell below the others in three areas. The desk staff did not seem to be really up on things, the internet was extremely slow and disconnected frequently, and the blackout curtains were inefficient and couldn't compete with a light that was right outside our window.
174	1	I think the price for the rooms was overpriced. The room was not very clean for the and the exhaust fan in the bathroom was very loud. There is a refrigerator and microwave in the room. The refrigerator did keep the stuff cold.
175	5	Hampton Inn's are always a good choice when travelling for business, this however was not a business trip. As usual the value for the dollar is high here, but for me one of the best things was the ability to park UNDER the hotel in an enclosed parking facility. You don't often find THAT in a reasonably priced hotel. Highly recommended.
176	2	Staff was courteous helpful and friendly. Great location however would not stay there again. Complimentary breakfast was good. Free parking. Rooms are clean but in need of updating. Beds are not comfortable at all. Thank you for your review. We greatly appreciate your feedback and we sincerely apologize for the bedding issues that you experienced during your stay. We will be sure to take your comments about our property under consideration as we re-evaluate guest needs and continually work to improve our guest experience. We hope you will consider staying with us again the next time your travels bring you to our area.Thanks again,Hotel Management
177	5	Del Mar Hampton Inn is 15 minutes from both Camp Pendleton and USMC Miramar where my conferences are held. Perfect location right on I-5. Great hotel. The hotel is very clean and staff go out of their way to help with anything. The breaksfast are nice, but the coffee is great. Overall this is one of my favorite Hampton Inns to stay at.
178	4	My wife and I love to stay at Hampton Inn because we know what to expect every time and for us that's a good thing. The only reason that I don't give it a 5 star review is that this location does not have fresh cookies. Only the Hampton's that have fresh cookies get a 5 star. Given that our stay included one of San Diego's wettest and coldest May day's in the past 100 years, we definitely enjoyed being able to park for free in the parking garage. It's the little things.
179	3	Breakfast need to be improve service is not bad rooms kinda smells like wet rag overall is clean not enough tables n chairs in the lounge good air conditioning the price is not too bad for a peak summer
180	3	An average Hampton Inn. However short on parking. (don't get there late at night) and poor wifi in rooms. (good in hallway and lobby) Great location for access to 5 fwy and Del Mar race track. Short drive to great beaches but definitely a drive, not a walk.
181	5	Booked one night for Sunday Memorial Day weekend, we found the lowest rate 110/night for holiday weekend compared to surrounding comparable hotels. The Cons: Hotel is oddly located behind the Residence Inn, across from the Doubletree, right next to the 56 freeway, gas station and Taco Bell, very small workout room and pool. The Pros: The outside appears bland but clean, the large inside lobby has a very relaxing welcoming set up, plenty of comfortable nice looking furniture seating areas, with roomy space and layout. Free Coffee and tea available all day in the lounge/breakfast area. Professional, welcoming customer service at check in and out, we were allowed to check in early about 0100. The included breakfast was very good, fresh and plenty of nice choices, great deal to be included in the nightly rate. There was eggs with ham, thick potato wedges, fresh fruit, tasty breads/muffins, fresh oatmeal, yogurt, cereals, juices, coffee, tea. Our room was roomy/clean, the ac worked well, bed felt great, nice linen/towels, freeway noise not too loud, good internet connection included. Free parking available in their lot and underground parking also. Within 15-20 mins. to La Jolla and downtown San Diego, very close to beaches. We were very happy and impressed with the service, our room, the hotel's large welcoming lobby setup, the wonderful breakfast, the great rate and relative proximity to other San Diego locations. We will definitely recommend and return to this Hampton.
182	5	My stay at this hotel was great! The room was clean, the king bed was so comfortable, and the breakfast options were on-point! The staff was very friendly and helpful answering any questions I had. The breakfast options varied with options each day (which is good)! And, this may sound strange, but the hallways smelled so fragrant. This shows that they maintain their appearance and uphold a clean standard (which is very important)! Overall, here are a few reasons why I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area: 1- friendly staff 2- very clean and well, maintained rooms AND building 3- FREE parking!!!! 4- breakfast is plentiful Enjoy!
183	3	This Hampton is clean and fresh. Newer decor. Nice location near the 5 freeway but there is No noticeable freeway noise. Staff is freindly and efficient Highly recommend for a reliable no frills location in Del Mar.
184	4	If driving to this hotel, be aware that this hotel is tucked behind a gas station. The weekend was quite busy and it was spring break. Breakfast got pretty crowded but th s is expected for such. Great value hotter. It was clean, I tell ya! My favorite part.
185	4	This Hampton Inn is well maintained and in a good location. The rooms are typical Hampton rooms. Good size and very clean. The staff was friendly and available. The breakfast was a bit of a mad house and seemed sparse.
186	5	Enjoyed staying at this location.Rooms were very comfortable and large.Location was easy to get to all attractions.Breakfast had a great variety of selections. Parking was easy accessd.Good location for handicap parking.
187	4	The hotel is new and clean. The parking is self park and free. The breakfast is good. The rooms were a bit long and narrow, but everything was clean. Just don't think you are going to hang by the pool as it's the size of my bathtub.
188	5	We stayed here to have easy access to Del Mar, La Jolla and San Diego. We were able to get to all places of interest on demand with no problems. The staff at this hotel is friendly and very good at providing the best service. Our room was clean that the carpet appeared new. We were able to park in the underground garage and take the elevator to our room. Overall, it was a safe, comfortable and pleasant experience.
189	5	Access to this hotel is easy as it is just off the freeway. The lobby and the rooms are clean and tastefully furnished. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast is excellent and there are many items to choose from. A great stay overall.
190	3	We were here for an early dinner before starting a tour, and the restaurant was not busy. Very modern looking, and the food was good, but nothing exceptional. I don't think I'd make it a destination for eating, however.Dear Lipadad,Thank you for sharing your experience at 750 Restaurant. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed the food but are disappointed we did not WOW you during your dinner. We appreciate your feedback as we look to make future improvements. We hope to welcome you back again in the near future.Megan B., Guest Relations
191	5	My spouse I have repeatedly stayed in this hotel when visiting family in the area, consistently finding it well maintained with a friendly, welcoming, competent staff. It is the only hotel for us in the area.
192	5	Very nice room. We sat in the lobby by the fire and had a snack with wine. Very nice and peaceful. Would stay here again. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Easy to find hotel. Lovely pool. Too cold tonight!
193	4	My 2 Freinds and I had tickets to see the Who on a Saturday night down in St. Louis and needed a room in order to not travel back to central Illinois after the show. Now on a Saturday night on Easter weekend it was very busy time for the city and not so easy to find the desired room... More
194	4	I would have given the Drury at the Arch a 5 rating, but gave it a 4 only because I think the rooms could use a little updating. Aside from that we loved our stay at the Drury Plaza at the Arch and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again in the future! I will also be looking for Drury Hotels... More
195	5	I've gone to this location even as a kid. It's the only place I'll stay when visiting the area. It's rooms have a pefect view of the arch and the river.

196	3	We enjoyed our first stay her at this location and received an overall good impression. We didn't realize it was right next door to the Knights inn Carmel hills and were afraid it might be a bad experience like it was at that hotel. Luckily it was completely different in a good way! The hot tub is great and the... More
197	5	This was a very nice and clean property. The staff was very accommodating and the evening cookies were great. Also, at least for my visit coffee was available any time I wanted some and the cookies went well with a nice cup of coffee! The free hot breakfast was good with srambled eggs, saugage/bacon and assorted fruit and bagels. Overall... More
198	1	We have stayed at a Hampton Inn several times because we are family of 5 and it is accommodating. Since the rate is usually between 125 and 200 you get what you pay for. This time we definitely DID NOT GET WHAT WE PAID FOR. Because it was Easter weekend, we were charged 350 per night. What we did get... More
199	5	Amazing Time! Friendly and Relaxing Hotel! My family and I felt extremely comfortable at this hotel. The front desk workers were very kind and helpful. The room had plenty of room. Will definitely be back again.
200	5	Very clean suite breakfast selections in the mornings we're awesome!! Including the waffle maker!! Fresh baked cookies every evening!! And the staff EVERYONE that I came in contact with for my week stay was alway pleasant and smiling faces and very helpful!!!

206	5	A group of us went for the weekend to Palm Springs and stayed at the Desert Eclipse.

208	3	The Bowen Hotel is an older but updated hotel that is cheaper than most of the other hotels we checked in Moab. Parking is kinda tight there, but manageable. Room was fairly large, but we discovered that housekeeping had not put a top sheet on the bed. The lady at the front desk was apologetic and gave us a sheet.... More
209	5	We came with a large family group and used four cabins. All were very well appointed. Only complaint was the one that my wife and I were in and it had a very squeaky floor (114). Otherwise the staff and accommodation's were all top notch. The harbor is a short two minute walk down a the pier and marina store.... More
210	5	Great location! The hotel has an excellent staff and wonderful rooms! Our room was nice and clean and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Great breakfast and nice swimming area as well.
211	4	I've stayed at the Dolphin Cove three times now. It has the best location of just about any beachfront motel you could find. However, you must come in the right frame of mind. It is not in any way fancy or elegant. It is a bit funky. I like that, but many people would find it too funky. While it's... More
212	2	This was at one time and could be again, a great place! Most of the rooms open to the hall and the outside. Problem is, people smoke right out side the doors, and some even left the doors to the halls open, so the smoke went through the entire hall and other rooms. I wondered why the staff never said... More
213	3	front-desk person was a nice young man, and the welcome bag was appreciated. was able to park right in front of my room and the highway noise wasn't too bad. needs a wastebasket in the bathroom, not just the main room. had fridge/microwave and small bathroom...perfect for a 1-night pass-through.
214	5	Don't let its outward appearance fool you. If you want a solid night's sleep on your journey, this is the hotel. The mattresses are firm and comfortable. (My back aches if I sleep on a lumpy/soft mattress.) My room was clean, and more importantly -- it smelled clean. (I never trust a motel that smells like mold/mildew.) And the staff... More
215	5	What a nice family owned motel. Brought back memories of what motels used to be like. Very clean, great price and pleasant and professional staff. Two great restaurants within walking distance is nice too.Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We are happy that you enjoyed your stay.
216	1	There are several other hotels in the area I would try the others before this one. I would not choose this Travelodge ever again. Service was not great rooms were bad. They even charge for ice. Good luck
217	4	great hotel, a bit old, but right in the thick of Waikiki beach - I totally would stay here again! The rooms are a bit small our balcony faced away from the beach, but still - a great deal for a nice simple room!!!!
218	5	We stayed here for two nights before our cruise. The room was clean, comfortable, and spacious. The staff was highly professional and courteous. The Hampton Inn breakfast is always delicious. This was a wonderful place to stay before sailing. The only down side: although there is a convenient parking garage, parking fees are extra.
219	5	Great room which was done very upscale way.The furniture was of the highest quality and made the room feel homely.Property looked beautiful from the outside and was located near some trendy restaurants.
220	5	Great Hampton in Brickell. Have stayed numerous times and has always been a wonderful hotel. Highly recommend for the location, cleanliness and the extremely pleasant staff. Welcoming and friendly. Can't wait to go back
221	5	I stay regularly here in Brickell and the hotel and staff never let me down. The hotel is right in the center of Brickell, next door to the bars and restaurants. The metro rail and transit line are at the end of the road and the train to Miami airport takes 20mins. This is a great place for business and... More

Wendy's and McD are in walking distance and multiple... More

234	5	Every part of the experience was 5-star. Yet the price was barely more than the older hotels in town. Very quiet rooms despite being next to the highway. Restaurants nearby, but not really walkable due to the highway. Nice pool.
235	4	The hotel was very nice and the breakfast was delicious but the buffet area is extremely cramped. Would be nice if they had pay per view so we could have watched the fight but other than that no complaints!
236	5	Come for the clean rooms and fluffy pillows but STAY for the full American Breakfast! Make your own waffle, pile on scrambled eggs, sausage patties, cover with sausage gravy. Then add a side of sausage flavored home fries and a croissant roll. Wash down with nice coffee and orange juice. Ahhhh. Traveling on a diet! I tried to steal the... More

269	4	This place was somewhat too expensive for me, but I chose it because close distance to the Convention Center was critical for me, and closer hotels were even more expensive. The place is just 10 minutes walk from the Convention Center. The road from the enter to the hotel is uphill. My room was clean and spacious, with a closet. The windows faced downhill with a broad view. The only problem was a fan below the windows. I heard its noise when I opened the window. Nevertheless, my overall rating is very good.Dear mikhail534, Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Hotel Sorrento.I am so pleased to know that you enjoyed the hotel's location and the guestroom appointments, I am, however, disappointed to learn of fan noise, when you opened the window. Please know that I very much appreciate your feedback, as it is only in this way that we can improve upon our shortcomings. We hope you will return again so we can ensure your stay is flawless from beginning to end. Best regards, Shannon Sheron, Managing Director
270	5	We had a great stay at the Sorrento. Staff was excellent very helpful with suggestions and making reservations for meals, etc. . We stayed in a Queen Suite. It's and older hotel with only 76 rooms but that's the type of hotel we like to stay in. They have a car that will take you anywhere in the downtown area. Location is excellent. Very easy to get around. There's a bar restaurant plus more restaurants and bars within walking distance. we love this review! Thank you for such kind words. Appreciate the praise!Randall ObrechtGeneral ManagerSorrento Hotel
271	5	I have stayed at a bunch of places in Seattle over the past 20+ years and my favorites have changed as staff, ownership, dating, maintenance, etc change. For years it was the Alexis then the Fairmont and Four Seasons then The Inn at the Market. the past few years we have stayed at the Hyatt but I thought I would try the Sorrento this weekend as I found a 249 suite deal. The rooms were huge and perfectly maintained and appointed. We loved having a book shelf filled with real books. The common areas were great and I honestly love a hotel where you can actually use the stairs anytime not just when the hotel is on fire. The staff was super friendly and helpful. This is our new favorite.Wow, parisryan, you know your Seattle hotels! I am thrilled that we are on the top of that prestigious list. Real books, real stairs, and super friendly staff, we have it all! Please come back and visit us again soon, we would be delighted to welcome you back. Cheers!Angie M.

272	3	This place has mostly construction workers and some other kinds of guests I care not to name...If you are looking for a place kind of on the questionable side this is the place for you..There always seemed to be something going on...
273	5	Modern loft vibe, with convenient built-ins, Bliss toiletries, comfy bed, and open lobby with lots of seating for drinking and eating. We were in town for Springstein concert and YUM center was only two blocks away. East valet parking and easy on/off interstate. We will definitely stay again!

277	5	Everything about the OB Hotel is fantastic. The rooms are well-appointed and comfortable. The balcony we had was great and had an awesome view of the ocean, the beach, the end of Newport...the whole scene. The staff was courteous and prompt. We were even able to check in a few hours early. Parking, while a bit tight, is right on site - a welcome feature in OB. What a great spot in a great town! Go and enjoy this wonderful hotel and all the area has to offer...
278	4	A simple nice hotel for the money. Nothing fancy, but it will do considering the price and location. I would stay there again. A little street noise, but not nearly as bad as I expected from its location right by the street. Great value.
279	5	This little hotel on the outskirts of town is a gem! Clean, comfortable and friendly! The rooms are large, and the staff was very efficient. We would definitely stay here again when we come wine tasting!Thank you for your great review and we are glad you had a fun time! See you on your next trip to the beautiful Napa Valley.
280	1	I am so sad I did not see the ratings for this place before I made 2 nights reservation. My family and I rented 3 rooms and what a mistake! One room had dirty sheets and we had to ask twice before they came and changed them. The maids did not seem happy about the ekstra work and for them where sheets with stains are apprently clean sheets no matter what. They even started to argue about it with my husband!The cable tv was not working proberly and the channels we could recieve was not even the same in all 3 room even though they where located right next to each other. Many of the channels kept on freezeing both the picture and the sound.No airconditioner in any of the rooms. The surrounding area seem quite dodgy, particuly at the back of motel. The homepage promise free high speed internet in all the rooms, but ups! That only works in the lobby! The beds are exstreamly small even acording to european standard! There are no refrigeater in the rooms. The window in the bedroom are plainted over with white paint so people can't look in, but several spots are free of paint and there are no curtain.Buttom line: I'm NEVER comming back again to this place!
281	5	This hotel is just spectacular! The staff is friendly and he service is phenomenal. The rooms are spacious with incredible views. Rooms have floor to ceiling windows. Its a small boutique hotel with lots of Meeting space and a great restaurant.
282	3	Decent hotel won on price line, rooms are extremely small. Staff was good. Location was OK at best.. Would rather pay more to be closer to the action and bigger rooms. Probably would pass on price line as well.Hi winks1996 - Thank you for choosing Hotel Felix for your recent visit to Chicago. While our rooms are cozy in nature, as Chicago's first Silver LEED certified hotel we're proud of our eco-friendly efforts. Thank you for posting your review and we hope to see you again soon.
283	4	Hotel Felix is in the heart of the Chicago action, minutes away from the Miracle Mile, great restaurants and the lake front. Found an amazing deal on line which made this affordable. Room was very small but clean and nice. Hotel staff courteous and friendly.Hi Mark C - Thank you for posting your review. We are glad you had a great stay with us and that the location was enjoyable for you. We appreciate your kind remarks about our staff. Thank you again and we hope to see you soon!
284	3	As Stash members we received a quiet room as requested on an upper floor away from the elevators. There was a musty odor to our tiny room that was otherwise clean and bright white when we entered. Toiletries are by L'Octane. Electrical outlets are adequate. Coffee and tea are served in the lobby in the morning. I was a little put off when a transient person walked in, used the lobby restroom, came out and made inquiries about jobs then proceeded to hang out talking loudly on a personal phone call. The staff seemed uncomfortable dealing with the situation.Hi VaporK8 - Thank you very much for posting your review. We appreciate your feedback, and we have shared your comments with our team. Thank you again for visiting us and we hope to see you soon.
285	4	A lot of the posted reviews are negative because of the smallness of the rooms. Ok people, the whole concept about boutique hotels are that they are small, unique with their usage of limited space and fairly reasonable because of it. If your principle concerns to have a large spacious luxury suite, than the Hilton millennium is down Michigan ave and will cost you at least 4 times the price. Then you can complain about the high cost of staying in Chicago. The Felix is located just 4 short blocks west of the Magnificent Mile and about a 15 minute stroll to the Navy Pier. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We arrived at just about noon and our room was ready. It was clean and fresh and the bed was very comfortable. There are numerous restaurants all around the facility and the area feels very safe. There is complimentary coffee and tea every morning and their is a small bar with limited times and services available.Overall we found our stay very comfortable and made our weekend in the Windy City a very enjoyable one.Hi Bolte59 - Thank you very much for posting your review. We are glad to hear that you enjoyed our urban location central to dining, shopping and more and that our helpful staff was able to assist you. Thank you again for your kind remarks feedback. We hope to see you again when you return to Chicago. Safe travels.
286	3	we stayed here for 6days,its in a good location,right at the gates of china town and trendy places to eat at,but it is old and the rooms need up dating,
287	3	The room was basic but clean, quite old fashioned and needs updating but the bed was comfortable enough and we got a quiet nights sleep where we were on the 7th floor. The room was cleaned each morning and fresh towels given. The free buffet breakfast was good, loads of different kinds of bagels, chocolate muffin/cakes, toast, eggs, cereal, tea and coffee. The bagels were the best i've tasted!! The breakfast room was very small and just a kitchen really but was nice and gave me that travelling vibe whilst i made and ate my toast alongside Germans, French and Dutch fellow travellers. One thing i did not like about the hotel was the lift!!! By the second day i was taking the stairs! All 7 flights of them...! The lift is tiny, very scary and just felt like it was about to go at any second! The hotel is situated right next to the Chinatown gateway which is a great location. 5-10 minute walk to Union Square and the main shopping area. One day we walked to the Coit Tower from the hotel and then kept on walking down to Fishermans Warf, if you look at the map you will see we covered some distance but in my opinion - its the best way to explore around. We even walked all the way back!!I was pleased with our stay, for the low price we paid we got a comfortable bed to sleep in, clean bathroom, free breakfast and it was in walking distance for pretty much everything we needed.
288	4	Clean comfortable room, accommodating staff, only a few complaints- room a bit cramped for 2 beds, street noise on front side and low water pressure in sink. Other than that, would recommend for overnight or long term stay.
289	1	The hotel is simply horrible, dirty, smelly and noisy beyond belief. The sheets have not been changed when we booked the room and mould and dirt were 'dripping' out of the extractor in the bathroom. Even for 100 a night it was a torture. I stayed in the area a few years ago in the Ramada hotel which is now unfortunately closed, the hotel was simply lovely. While searching for a similar hotel, Greenwich Inn appeared, I don't know what I was thinking booking it..
290	5	Don't let the outside looks fool you! This might be a motel kinda of place but the owners did a fantastic job renovating it to today's standards. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. As we got there late evening, they helped me locate a parking spot within the property. (review of parking to follow so keep reading)We got a 2 queen room and it was much bigger than I expected. There was plenty of room to roam around without feeling cramped. Everything was clean and well appointed: big flat screen TV, microwave and fridge, coffee maker, iron, closet. Beds and pillows were very comfy. There were also TONS of outlets (including usb) to charge all your electronics. Bathroom was just the the best. It is an open tiled bathroom with the most amazing water pressure ever. It felt like getting a massage in the shower! They offered a light breakfast but we didn't try it. Plenty of really good restaurants less than 5 min walk away with a lot of choices (italian, japanese, brunch, veg/vegan, chinese, mexican, you name it.) Although parking is free at this hotel, the parking lot is limited and a bit tight which can be unnerving if you drive a big truck. We were lucky to get the last parking spot on our first night (it looked like they were sold out and parking lot was full) But did I say it was free :) Just park the car and take the bus. There is a bus stop less than 5 minute walk away. It was a 20 min ride to the Wharf and also 15 mins to Golden Gate Bridge Visitor Center.On the down side, it can get noisy as it is just off the street and you can hear cars pass by. It didn't bother us too much though and we still got a good night sleep. If you are light sleeper, just be aware. What a lovely review! Thank you for taking the time to go into so much detail to demonstrate how happy you were. You had the experience that we want to provide for each and every one of our guests! We are delighted that our property was such a wonderful match for your accommodation requirements, and we hope to welcome you back again soon! Best wishes, Hotel Management
291	5	We stayed here for 2 nights and the women at the desk were wonderful. We got there on a Tuesday evening only to find out that most everything in town was closed as it wasn't season yet. The desk clerk was so helpful telling us what she thought would be open and gave us copies of menus to help us.... More
292	2	You can't expect much for 50, however our room was clean, although the furnishing are well worn. The bathroom was large and AC worked. The area attracted homeless folk which may put guests at ill-ease. Doors did triple lock.
293	3	We were in San Francisco for 6 days, and we stayed at the Monarch.They were nice enough to check us in early,but the room had a slight smell and a view of the apartment that was 10 feet away. The bed was clean,but the pillows really really flat,and I am not a pillow person.It was cold in the room so bring warm socks(this was in Aug), warm pajamas and a pillow.The washrooms were clean and the bathtub deep.The safe did not work and if the temp.outside was hot,we would be in trouble,because it the AC was missing knobs.The tv had 15 channels and HBO( a few great movies).The Wi-Fi worked and the morning coffee was good. The biggest problem was that the area was loud at night with the homeless and druggies talking/yelling until 1am.In the morning the homeless were very visable and at night,I would not want to be coming in late if you are on your own. SO the hotel it self is worth the savings,but the area I something to really really consider and I am a city girl.Stay in little Italy or near the Warf,these are the cleaner and safer areas. Enjoy your time in San Francisco!
294	4	How lovely to finally find our hotel and discover the sign reads the NARCH HOTEL!, thankfully it didnt live up to its accidently given name! The reception staff were polite, if a little unapproachable, we had to discover all the facilities of the hotel by roaming around....only after 5 daysof braving the homeless people to use the phone in the street, did we discover the payphone and vending machines. They could really use a map of the hotel, or at least show you the facillities on arrival. Our room was comfy and clean, the bed was a brilliant size and so nice to crawl into after scaling the hills all day!! The maid service was excellent. The down sides were apparent straight away, our room was facing the corner of a busy junction, on the 6th floor....the constant traffic woke us up frequently as did the fire trucks which used their sirens freely and at least twice in the night, every night!!!!! The area is dodgy looking but actually not as bad as we anticipated, true there are homeless people everywhere and the street cleaners dont seem to venture that far, but we never had any trouble ( in fact i encountered more scary situations in the lift with non english speaking leery men who find it 'funny' to wedge you into a corner...) most homeless people were friendly or kept to themselves. Take a right as you come out the hotel, and you'll find a fantastic sandwhich shop QUIZNOS, right again and a cinema,diner and cocktail bar which are all really nice yet not mentioned in our guide. Lovely trip overall!!!
295	2	We arrived in San Francisco on the Friday, did some sight seeing, bought souvenirs, We eventually got to the hotel around 9pm, we parked on the street just minutes away from the hotel, there were a few homeless people in the streets and didn't think too much of it, Next morning we went to our rental vehicle only to see it was broken into and a few of our belongings were stolen, The front desk was helpful in calling the police for us to get things sorted out. The next night we chose to pay for the valet service at 35.00 a night. because once we did more driving around we realized it was a very bad neighbourhood, not child friendly or even adult friendly for that matter . The hotel offered coffee and juice and the morning and this was not very good. Overall was not enjoyable to stay
296	5	We wanted to be close to public transportation, the wharf, and attractions. The room was nicely done and we could watch the sunset from our window. We had asked for early check-in but even though they told us we could get in at 2pm they did not have our room ready until the normal 4.00pm check-in. But they did give... More
297	5	Great Reno location for travelers. Staff is friendly accommodating. Have a small bar with snacks a breakfast is included in price of room. A would definitely recommend the Hyatt Place especially for people who want a comfortable hotel want to escape the casino atmosphere.
298	3	Not too many choice in this area but this hotel seems like the best choice. We rented one of the cabins. The locations is excellent, they have tall trees everywhere plus chairs and fire pits outside each cabin. Our cabin (and our friends cabin) was a bit worn out. The biggest disappointment was the fireplaces in each cabin did not... More

303	4	It was an okay distance from Universal Studios, to far to walk but was a short cab ride. Around 8. Lots of restaurants and an outlet mall short cab rides away. Pool and hot tub area is great. Staff super friendly and helpful.
304	1	Breakfast buffet worthy of a motel 6, showing the chain's true heritage. Most Intercons I've stayed at WW, have a much higher levels of service, training and food quality. This no frills meal served at Luce was a waste of 30.
305	4	I stayed at this hotel because we were going to an event at Philips Arena. I would not hesitate again to stay at this hotel. The staff was VERY friendly, helpful and knowledgeable of the area.10 parking fee is the only negative but our car was safe (over all)...We were within walking distance of several places to eat and this is a fine place. There are NICER places but for the value, it was great.Other rooms during this weekend were 130 and up and I got ours for 80wingslogo84,Thank you for your review. I'm glad to read that you enjoyed your stay. We hope to see you again when you next travel to Atlanta.

We have been updating and upgrading our rooms and the general appearance of our property. I hope you have safe travels in the future. Sincerely,Enoch D.
306	4	Yes, somewhat shabby and needs updated mattresses and furniture and yes, there was a musty but not moldy smell some of the time.

I hope they invest some time and money into updating this place... More

310	3	We had 4 adults and 1 child (age 7). This was our grandchild's first trip away from home. Room 120 is marketed as a suite. It's not. It's a regular hotel room with 2 queen size beds and then a closet with a full size bed inside of it. I kid you not!The grandparents (us) wanted a seperate bedroom so we were stuck in the closet. There was not enough room for 2 adults to walk around in the room. You open the door and there's the bed. There was 6 from the edge of the opened door to the edge of the bed. The bed was up against the wall. There was one tv in the entire suite. That tv was outside of the closet bedroom. There was one side table lamp in the suite and that was not in the closet bedroom. The closet bedroom had a floor lamp on the opposite side of the closet from the bed and a blaring overhead light. There was just enough room in the closet bedroom to open one piece of luggage. There was a very small side table in the closet bedroom where one could put their clothes in...a bit tough if there's 2 adults in the closet bedroom staying 4 nights. What little carpet you were exposed to in the closet bedroom was sticky as though someone had spilled a soft drink by the side table.Had we known this we never would've booked here. Thus the reason for me writing to help other guests.The staff was extremely nice. We had rented a scooter and that was left in the hotel lobby overnight as none of the hotel rooms on the property would be able to accomodate a scooter. We were provided with plenty of clean towels in the one small bathroom in our suite.The pool was very clean.The breakfast consisted of frozen donuts (no microwave is available in the lobby eating area...if you wanted them heated up you had to take it to your room and use your microwave there), powdered scrambled eggs, bagels, small yogurts, a few pieces of fruit, milk, juice and coffee. Cereals were available from the bulk cereal dispenser and there was a waffle maker. The breakfast area was tiny. Since we stayed here from Oct 23 - Oct 27 there weren't a bunch of families to battle with in this breakfast area. I can not even fathom eating in the breakfast area during summer vacation, spring break, or during the holiday season when multiple families are in abundance. The seating consisted of 4 tables...2 tables accomodated 4 people and 2 tables accomodated 2 people (12 people total in the seating area). Of note, since this was something we had never experienced in any other hotels we've stayed in over a 40+ year span, there were two police vehicles parked outside the lobby with officers in the lobby that started one of our mornings off before heading to the Happiest Place on Earth. We didn't want to know what may have happened for their being there but the officers weren't there to partake in the breakfast, if you catch my drift.Parking was adequate and free. The maids like to trash talk about the guests in Spanish. This might be ok for persons who aren't Spanish-fluent, but we are. There's a sand pit playground area in the courtyard. It seemed to be in good repair. Our grandson didn't play in the area. I can't speak for any noise level this may cause in the rooms that surround the courtyard.Don't say you weren't warned. You get what you pay for. And no, we would never stay here again.
311	4	We stayed here for three nights while visiting Disneyland. We had two rooms, one standard (for the in-laws) and one suite. We booked the suite in order to have a separate sleeping room for the kids. The extra room, however, was very small (just enough room to unfold the bed) and couldn't be used for much more than sleeping (it had no TV). Strangely, the extra room also lacked any heat (it only had a cooling unit). We were in Anaheim during a cold spell in January so this was problematic but didn't ruin our stay.The standard room seemed a bit more updated than the suite but, aside from some peeling paint, both rooms were clean and comfortable. The hot breakfast was perfect (selection included belgian waffles, eggs, sausages, toast, pastries, cold cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit) but, as has been noted by other reviews, the seating area is woefully inadequate. Fortuntately, we weren't there during a busy time so the lack of room was more of a nuisance than anything else.I estimated the walk to Disneyland front gates to be about a mile. For us, it took 15 to 20 minutes, which was what we expected.Service was friendly and attentive. All in, given the price, we thought the value was excellent and would stay here again.Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay with us. I am checking into the issue you had with no heat in the suites extra room. I am also having the bathrooms repainted as we speak. I will speak to our staff again about reporting any issues about the rooms to me. Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I assure you that they will be fixed by your next visit.
312	4	I stay here due to the proximity to Disneyland, it's a quick walk to the parks, and because I get the Best Western rewards. If you book enough in advance the prices are in line with the cheaper cost hotels. All BW hotels have decent beds, bathrooms, come with microwave and fridge with a good TV and channels. The housekeeping staff does a good job with the cleaning. They do not offer breakfast, but they do give Denny's breakfast vouchers and they offer a go bag in the morning with an apple, a granola bar, and a small water. I'm usually in too much of a hurry to get to Disneyland to where breakfast doesn't matter anyways. The Stovall's BW is a few hotels closer, but is usually a little more and they charge for parking, but they have a full breakfast. Both are good to stay in. The BW on Ball Rd is nice too, but the walk is further.
313	4	My daughter and I enjoyed five nights at this hotel which was comfortable and convenient to buses to Disneyland, Universal Studios and also Outlet Mall shopping. Kelly on the front desk provided helpful suggestions for our excursions.It was very much a family-oriented hotel close to the action.There was no continental breakfast available but we were on the go so much that it didn't really matter. I would recommend this as a convenient, comfortable and clean hotel to take your family to with a lovely pool and hot tub. The fireworks from the Disneyland Park could be seen from the hotel poolside each evening.Pleased with our stay.
314	4	This is a clean and well-located motel. There is ample parking and the breakfast is your choice so 3 items plus a drink from Denny's. Very impressive. We walked across the street and cut through the employee parking to get to Universal Studios which cut 5 minutes off the walk. Great place to stay. They offer park tickets and a shuttle if you don't want to walk.
315	2	We pick this place to stay in Anaheim, price is what we can afford and it is clean and comfortable. It is a half mile walk to our destination and an easy walk. We don't have to worry about the high parking rate at the Convention Center.Thank you for your recent stay. Thank you for taking the time to provide us with feedback. We look forward to your next visit to Anaheim.
316	4	We stayed here to go to California Adventure before our cruise. Pleasant surprise! It's an older place that's being kept up nicely. Room very clean, bed very comfy. Denny's is next door and the shuttle stop is right there too. The only thing that was...More

320	4	My friend and I got a good rate on this hotel it was clean, quiet and well maintained. The bed could have been a bit softer and the breakfast a little more substantial, but for the price I have no complaints. The location is good and the staff was friendly. Would definitely stay there again.
321	3	This is an older hotel but my room was comfortable and clean however the furnishings are old. The best rooms face outside as the pool are can get very noisy ! The breakfast area is very small with a bad selection of items, however there is a diner next door if you want a cooked breakfast !

338	2	This place is a Marriott but I've stayed at Courtyards that were nicer than this dump. This place should be re-branded to a lower quality Marriott Property. When I see that a property is a Marriott (and not a Residence Inn, Fairfield, Courtyard, etc) I believe it is a NICE place with HIGH QUALITY standards. This property was not that.Room was okay. Nothing special. The room was overpriced by about double for the property.Breakfast was fine, the buffet is priced similarly to other Marriotts. Coffee was average.Location is near Little Italy and the Medical school. Not an awesome part of town and the property matches the neighborhood (not awesome). It's not the ghetto but there are definitely nicer looking areas in Chicago.I will not stay here next time I'm in Chicago. It may be the closest Marriott property to my client but there's plenty of public transportation in downtown Chicago, you can stay other nicer places that aren't over-priced (I recommend Blackstone Renaissance!)
339	5	Stayed here on business with the University of Illinois Medical Center. The negative of a hotel in the Medical District is the sirens. Lots of ambulances coming to the Medical Centers. That and the charge for internet access were the only negatives I experienced here, and I will admit that paying for internet access is a pet peeve of mine. The ambulances they have no control over. The hotel has a modern contemporary appearance. The lobby was bright and inviting with a sitting area offering complementary Wall Street Journal and USA Today. Every staff member I encountered was cheerful and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable, with complementary coffee/tea, a refrigerator, and a great work area. I was not able to see any restaurants within walking distance so I opted for the hotel restaurant/bar. The food was excellent as was the service and all reasonably priced for Chicago. They do have a shuttle service available however, I did not use it and unable to comment. Coming back in two-weeks and will be staying here again, even though I have to pay for internet access. :-)QuitemanTravels,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us, and I am so happy to hear how satisfied you were with your experience. I appreciate your kind words concerning our staff and facilities, and will make sure to share them with our Team.As you mentioned, we do offer special rates for those visiting the Illinois Medical District as well as the University of Illinois at Chicago.We also have several package rates that include wifi and parking, as a way to lower the costs of these amenities. Our wifi price does also include all local and long-distance calls made from the room.As well as our wonderful restaurant that you had a chance to experience, we are walking distance from Little Italy, and a complimentary shuttle-ride from Greektown.Thank you again for taking the time to write about your stay, and please feel welcome to contact me if you are in Chicago again soon.In the Spirit to Serve,Adam NemirowHotel Manager
340	4	Hotel staff was friendly upon checking in, Hotel provided short radius shuttle for shopping trips.. Hotel lacked indoor or outdoor pool, the rooms did not carry microwaves. Maid service was overly noisy during the weekend. Surrounding area was nice quiet and close to Little Italy. The attached restaurant Rooks corner I felt was overpriced but the food and the service for good.
341	2	I have stayed at this hotel before without any problems. I am a Marriott Platinum member, so I always get placed on the Concierge floor. This time the hotel checked me into Room 420 on the top floor. When it was time to go to bed, I found the bed to be HARD AS A ROCK. I was used to the luxurious Marriott Beds (they sell the mattresses), but this thing was impossible. It was late and I ended up sleeping on the Duvet Cover for some padding. When I reported this they said they would take care of it. The next day after work (after getting little sleep the night before), I tested the bed. Another very thin pad had been placed on the bed. I had had it. I called the Manager to come to the room and housekeeping. The housekeeper was fantastic. She knew just want to do. While she was padding my mattress I noticed something unusual. The tag on the mattress said Beauty Rest, Custom Made for Hyatt Hotels. This particular hotel had not been a Hyatt since 2003!! (And who knows how long the mattress had been there, so it was AT LEAST 10 years old). The manager explained he was sorry but that they had budgeted for new mattresses. COME ON. This hotel charges Michigan Avenue rates and is NOT close to downtown. I could not believe it. On the positive side, the host in the Concierge Lounge was incredible. The breakfast was amazing and the service was great.Finally when I checked out, I noticed an added room charge. I complained and was told I would have to come down to the desk at check out. I gave the erroneous bill to the desk staff. She looked at it and I told her which one was billed erroneously. Then she said what day is that... Good grief.. she was LOOKING at the bill. Finally just said Take the charge off now. I guess from talking to the manager that it is hit or miss whether you can a new or an old mattress. And after all, a good nights sleep is a BASIC requirement for business travel. I will not stay here again... period... obviously customer comfort is not 1.And what did I get my all this trouble 1,000 extra points. That's it, Marriott UIC.. None of my business for you!
342	4	For those who require wheelchair accessible rooms, you will find this Marriott a very good option. The bathroom size was excellent but the room was somewhat hard to manoeuvre as the furniture is quite bulky and did not provide much room for turnaround.Also, this Marriott has a wheelchair accessible van (brand new) and will drive visitors within a 1-mile radius which includes UIC, Rush, John Stroger (Cook County) and to Little Italy and Greek town - they also pick up!Restaurant food was excellent and very generous
343	5	I stayed at this hotel while in town for a conference. The main conference hotel was fully booked so I used Trip Advisor to look for an alternative, and found the Horton Grand. I wanted something interesting and authentic rather than international-hotel-chain-plastic, and the Horton Grand really delivered. Yes, it's shabby in places and some of the wooden furniture and fitments are chipped and knocked about, but that really didn't matter. Staying here was lovely. With the benefit of reviews from previous guests on TA I asked for and was given a room at the back of the hotel. People coming out of the nightclub opposite still got a bit noisy on a couple of nights (I was there over the Memorial Day weekend) but I'm a light sleeper and it didn't disturb me over-much. There was worse noise from the room upstairs: the floors (although carpeted) are wooden, and there must have been a family of elephants staying up there! It still wasn't enough to put me off though. If you want a quiet hotel, don't stay in the middle of the entertainment quarter!Service was good, my room was clean, and breakfasts were fine.If you want an experience that's a little different from the McDonald's type of hotel, this one is for you :-)
344	5	Stay at the Lodi Best Western in California was very good. The lady at check in, Maria was outstanding and very helpful - Breakfast was also good - The room was good, and the bed also , Internet was good and fast
345	5	We stayed in a standard king room which was more than adequate for our needs. Very spacious, great bed and bathroom. The location was great, very central to many attractions. The staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a pleasant stay. I would definitely recommend to stay at the Orchard Garden.Thanks for the praise! Were always happy to go above and beyond, Suzanne. Give us a call if you're ever visiting San Francisco again, we'd be more than happy to help you with accommodations. Best,Pablo B. General Manager
346	5	My wife and I spent lots of time searching for hotels in San Francisco - we were travelling to the city for our 10th wedding anniversay, so we wanted something special. We were really worried by some of the reviews of other hotels (too noisy, poor location, bad smells, poor service, etc.). By chance, we happened upon a review of the Orchard Garden Hotel. It looked good via the website and our initial contact with staff on the booking line was positive. So we took a chance. It helped that the hotel promoted its eco-credentials.When we got there, we were really pleased with our choice. Just steps away from the China Town gate, a few minutes from Union Square and about 10 minutes walk from the nearest BART station - so plenty of bustle if we wanted. However, the road the hotel is on is a relatively quiet one and this is helped by really good double-glazing (as you might expect from an eco-hotel). To be fair, we were staying on the 9th floor. But the room ventilation was quiet and there were no other noises to disturb our sleep - beds are really comfortable, too.The rooms are very nice with a good, clean and light decor. Nicely appointed, too. We ate in the restaurant the first night - the food is very good but, as you might expect from a hotel in SF, quite expensive. We knew it would be and it didn't detract from the experience. We ate breakfast at one of the many cafes in the area - once again, this hotel is in a good location.The staff are friendly and genuinely welcoming with good local knowledge. There is even a little room with a couple of PCs and a printer for Internet access.In conclusion, we are really happy with our choice of hotel and will defintely make this our hotel of choice for our next trip to SF. I thoroughly recommend the Orchard Garden.
347	5	This is by far the best hotel in the USA we ever stayed in. Who cares the view on some backyard from the window. Not one sound from the busy Bush Street can be heard. The rooms on front should be sound proof according the hotel staff. The breakfast is basic and rather expensive. Cold hard boiled eggs, bread, coffee or tea and juices from the bottle and of course some cereals. For additionals high priced extras can be ordered. We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. The dinner food is great, but the choice very limited, so we had to go to the French restaurant Restaurant de la Presse on the opposite of the entrance in Bush Street. One remark about the sound proof quality of our room. At one moment it looked like our neighbours were really inside our room. They had a normal conversation and we could understand every word of it!!! So we were just lucky with quiet neighbours who did not shout or laughed loud or put on the TV set maximum! You better go for a room without connecting doors.The hotel is extremely green and was awarded for this, too. Free WiFi, which works fast all the time.A special compliment to the porters, who proved to be very helpful with good tips.
348	5	We stayed at this hotel over St. Patrick's day. The experience was fantastic! The staff were polite and helpful. The rooms were exceptionally clean and comfortable. I also liked some of the environmentally friendly features that are built in. The rooftop patio was quite enjoyable. I will definitely stay there again.I'm happy you all decided to stay with us over St. Patrick's Day, and it's great to hear that you thought our staff and rooms were impressive. It means a lot that you'll stay with us again. We can't wait!Warm regards,Pablo B. General Manager
349	4	Right on the doorstep of Chinatown, good walk to the wharf area. Very easy to stop outside and drop bags off. We got rid of our car otherwise parking is 55 per night so beware if you are driving here. All staff were brilliant, room was clean and ready to go. Fitness room just about served its purpose, but only 3 machines, could be a problem at rush hour. We're happy you had such a nice stay with us, Ikorel! It sounds like you enjoyed everything from our rooms to our staff. Stop back in again soon. We'd love to have you.Best,Pablo B. General Manager
350	5	What a great boutique hotel, just outside the entrance to ChinaTown. Just can't beat the location, which is walking distance to everything. Really nice rooms and service. No realy separate bar area, and I didn't eat there. But, you can walk everywhere from here, so no matter. Recommend the rooms and location.Thank you for the great review. I am so pleased to read that you stay was a good one. I could not agree more about the location. Many points of interest are an easy walk from the hotel. The others are a simple bus or cable car ride away. We truly appreciate you sharing your experience and recommending our hotel. CheersQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
351	5	Steps away from the Dragon Gate entrance into Chinatown, this modern, environmentally friendly hotel was a great place to stay. The staff at the front desk, the bellman, and the waitstaff were helpful, friendly, and courteous. The rooms were very quiet on the ninth floor. Bedding was comfortable and shower facilities acceptable. Requests were prompt. Breakfast downstairs seemed pricey until you realized it came with juice, fruit, and coffee. Not one complaint on the quality or service. The location is close to Union Square, Chinatown, and the Financial District. I would highly recommend this hotel.Dear guest Emmacakes,Your comment is well appreciated and will be shared with all team members so they read the great feedback from our guests. Breakfast is an experience in itself and well worth the value considering all the extra additions we provide.Looking forward to welcoming you back soon, Pablo B. General Manager
352	3	Stayed here for business so unsure what the normal rate is but this was pretty cheap compared to others so it was a good value. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Bathroom is average with average shower. I liked the slippers and robe. Lobby is small and service was fine. My main complaint is the fitness center is very small with only three cardio machines and know weights. They offer passes at another gym for 15. Good location near china town and financial district. Overall pretty decent hotel. I'm glad that you enjoyed your stay with us, Aditya! Our staff is here to make your stay better, so don't hesitate to ask them if you have any questions or concerns. As for the fitness center, I apologize that it wasn't quite big enough for you. As you mentioned, we have discounted passes to a local gym. However, space is tight, so we're limited in our ability to expand it. If there's anything else we can do to make your next experience a five-star one, please don't hesitate to reach out. All the best,Collins C., Front Office Manager
353	5	The staff at the Orchard Garden Hotel is very interested in getting to know their guests. Finding out where they have traveled and why they are visiting San Francisco. The staff does make a lot of suggestions for sites and things to do, all very welcomed. I did wish the hotel provided free bottle water in the room. Breakfast was reasonably priced for being in a big city, the staff is very attentive.I'm thrilled that you found our staff so helpful and welcoming, Batrik -- that's exactly as it should be! As for the bottled water, we believe that providing these would go against our green initiative goals. That being said, I'm so pleased that the rest of your stay was enjoyable! Safe travels home, and we look forward to welcoming you back to San Francisco.Best,Collins C., Front Office Manager
354	4	Nice hotel. Chinatown 10metres away. rooms clean and tidy. comfortable. Reception really obliging and polite an friendly. Only concern was a sign that was in an obscure place stating it was a health hazard staying at this hotel and that it could cause cancer. upon asking receptionist what this was about - she didnt know!! We found this on checking out - so a little advice to the Orchard Garden Hotel - if there is not health hazard - remove that bloody sign - if there is - then we should know about it BEFORE we book so we can make an informed decision.Thank you so much for sharing your experience with the Orchard Garden Hotel. Although I am delighted to read the property was to your liking, I am so very sorry regarding the confusion behind the warning sign. I will make sure everyone at the front desk knows where the pamphlets are explaining the details.In 1986 California voters approved an initiative (proposition 65) to address their growing concerns about exposure to toxic chemicals. The Office of Environmental Hazard Assessment requires all businesses to notify patrons of such toxins. They have put together a list that contains a wide range of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals that can harm people. Some of the chemicals listed are additives or ingredients in pesticides, common household products, food, drugs, dyes or solvents. Listed chemicals may be used in manufacturing and construction, or they may be byproducts of chemical processes, such as motor vehicle exhaust.As a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified hotel we really dont use many chemicals at all, but we still have the sign to be compliant. We pride ourselves as a smoke free hotel. Our housekeepers use green seal certified cleaning products, which are just as effective as harsh traditional cleaners. Rooms and halls are fitted with 2 recycled carpeting that sets off a low V.O.C (volatile organic compound) and 100 recycled padding under the carpet. All fabrics are made with recycled polyester and other textiles without chemicals and are machine-washed to avoid the chemicals that come with dry cleaning. Although the food provided in the restaurant is organic from local farms, needless to say the liquor served at the bar can be harmful to someone pregnant. I hope you find comfort in this brief explanation. If you like I would be more than happy to send you more information regarding OEHHA and Proposition 65. All of us here would be elated to have you stay with us again hopefully you can choose us without hesitation.Kind regards,Quinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
355	5	Great place right next to China Town and Union Square. Lots of eco-features, quiet room with view of the financial district on 10th floor. The room was very clean - both spouse and I are suffering from dustmite allergy and had no problems here.Thank you so much for taking time to write about your experience while staying with us. As an eco-friendly hotel we only use green seal certified cleaning products for dusting and cleaning. We are very happy to able to accommodate people with sensitive allergies. We hope that you decide to stay with us again.Kind regards,Quinn McEntee
356	5	Stayed here for a week with my husband and two teenage sons, I choose this hotel because of the reviews and location.Check in and out was very efficient carried out by friendly and helpful staff, Concierge Staff were equally as helpful and professional through out the week.Our room, and indeed the whole hotel, was very clean and tastefully decorated.There was enough space for all of us and we each found the beds to be very soft and comfortable. Only downside was, although it was great to have a small coffee machine, it wasn't big enough nor did we have enough tea or coffee, or even cups for four people. I did ask on several occasions for more, but I did get fed up asking. This also went for the towels, having asked, again on several occasions, we only received three bath towels! We were there 7 days and I had paid for four adults so I am a bit of a loss why this kept happening. It was a bit irritating and slightly lacking on such a good hotel. I hope this will be rectified for future patrons.There is a small gym and a business centre with two computers and a printer, very handy for checking in to your airline and printing out boarding passes.The terrace garden is small but it was lovely to have a picnic alfresco in the city.I can't comment on the food here as we ate out all the time as there are loads of places to choose from locally. Walgreens Supermarket just up the street and left on Powell. Union Square just a little further down.In my book a clean hotel and location is key for me and the location of this hotel was spot on, easy access to all forms of transport, BART from the airport, trams, buses, muni metro and streetcar. Right next to the Chinatown Gate and easy access to all the tourist spots.We all really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and in San Francisco in general, lots to see and do and the people are really friendly and welcoming where ever we went, and to cap it all off the Giants won the World Series and we were treated to a Homecoming Parade in their honour.....awesome.This hotel has good Eco friendly practices and will plant a tree for every review posted.Thank you for your great review, and as promised, we will definitely plant a tree for you for leaving a review on TripAdvisor! As you know we do this for all reviews, but are happier when it is done for a positive review. I'm so sorry to hear that your requests for tea, coffee and towels were never appropriately met. Although it sounds like you enjoyed your stay overall, I will make sure to work with the team so that going forward they can improve their performance. I'm happy that you were able to take full advantage of the public transportation and enjoyed all the sights this beautiful city has to offer! If you ever find yourself traveling back, we would certainly love to host you again!And we agree a clean hotel and location are vital to a great staySincerely,Bruce P.Front Office Manager
357	5	I have only great things to say about Orchard Garden Hotel. The location is ideal and the room was spotless (it's not very often I feel comfortable taking a bath in a hotel but I did there every day). The staff was helpful and very friendly, made me feel very much at home. Wifi worked well. I would stay there again.We're delighted you were able to relax with some cozy bath time, Denise! Vacation is all about feeling calm and comfortable while you explore a new place. We'd love to have you back someday!Wishing you all the best,The Orchard Garden Hotel
358	3	I stayed at the Orchard Garden last month, as business took me to San Francisco and there were literally no other hotel rooms available downtown between 75 and 450 per night some huge conference was going on and there was NO hotel availability. So I chose this hotel out of necessity (as I really had no choice), but was pleasantly surprised during my stay. The hotel is green, which I appreciate. Biodegradable bath product packaging (although the products themselves are still full of chemicals, boo), room key controlled lighting (very European), etc. The bathroom floor was heated (huge bonus in the morning) and the room was spacious enough. My view was of another close building, so that left a bit to be desired, and my room smelled of old lady perfume a little. I wasn't able to check out the rooftop garden but heard from a colleague that it's a great spot when the weather is nice. This hotel probably isn't my first choice for future trips to SF, as it was farther from my office than I'd like and I have other favorite hotels in the city, but it's definitely doable and I would stay here again if need be.Thank you for sharing your experience during your recent visit to San Francisco and our Hotel. Im thrilled you were pleasantly surprised during your stay and truly appreciate your feedback. Although it seems you enjoyed a majority of your stay, I am sincerely sorry about the lingering smell of the perfume. All of us here at the Orchard Garden Hotel would love if you decided to stay with us again. Thanks again Quinn McEntee Front Office Manager
359	5	Nice, clean, modern rooms right next to Chinatown and easy walking distance to Union Square. Weve stayed in several San Francisco hotels and this is one of our favorites. Very courteous, helpful hotel staff.We're happy you're happy! Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. It's cool to hear you enjoyed everything from our staff to our walk-able neighborhood. Hope you stay with us again soon! Best, Pablo B. General Manager
360	4	Good, clean rooms. Small-medium sized but the room amenities were complete and nothing to complain about.Excellent service and very friendly/accomodating staff.Environment-friendly. We like that they commit to plant trees for every trip advisor review.Thank you so much for the kind review and for commending us on our eco-conscious efforts. We opened in 2006 as a LEED (Leadership in Energy Environmental Design) certified Hotel and since then we have been thinking of ways to be even greener. With suggestions from staff and guests, we have made a number of changes that will reflect in the next LEED certification renewal. I do not want to spoil the big news to come, but we are very excited. We are also thrilled to be affiliated with a campaign such as Plant a Billion Tees. With the help of our guests we have planted 200 trees this last quarter in an effort to restore the Atlantic Rain Forrest, which is only 12 percent of its original size. Trees store an enormous amount of carbon dioxide and in return releases oxygen, something we think is valuable, especially in the travel industry.Thanks again for choosing to stay with us and we hope to see you again soon.Kind regardsQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
361	4	I stayed here one night and it was really nice. Rooms were clean and the bed was super. Location is great just by the china town gates.The negativesBad sound proofing between rooms (we could here neighbors talking) No view (from our room at least)Gym was closet size and 3 different walking machines.But overall a nice stay at a great location.
362	5	Excellent rooms, excellent service, nice people, great location, Parking is cheap for SF with in and out privileges. Beautiful public places, fine breakfast. 50 feet from China town, 5 blocks from the north end, three blocks from Union Square, not far from museums and Mosconi center. Powell Street cable car to Fisherman's Wharf is 3 blocks. It doesn't get any better than this.Thank you Bruce G for a fantastic review!We truly appreciate your comment of being a real gem and that it doesn't get any better than this which is what we aim to be.Looking forward to welcoming you back soon, Pablo B. General Manager
363	1	The building is well located next to Union Square in San Francisco, 2 steps from Cable Car station. a Theatre occupies the first floors of the building.At the reception the staff is very standard, nothing more.Room I was given (and I was upgraded on last floor) is so old that no other word come to my mind than dirty. No Air conditioner, a fan is at your disposal on the ceiling, above the bed, and you can open the window.Bathroom is small, and especially needs to be renovated.For the same price you can leave in a much better Hotel in San Francisco.Dear Matthieu L,Thank you very much for taking your time to share your comment with us on TripAdvisor. I am so sorry to hear our hotel didn't meet your expectation. Our hotel offers different style of rooms and I wish we could offer you a different room if we have known this during your stay with us. Our hotel just recently updated all the guest rooms furniture such headboard, dressers, night stands and mini fridges. All the guest's floor hallway carpets are renewed and as well as lobby furniture. We are going to renew the guest's room carpet very soon, and also working on minor renovation in each guest's room. I hope you would give us a second chance for your next visit in San Francisco. Thank you again for staying with us.
364	4	I stayed here during Oracle OpenWorld, which if you know of it is a massive event in San Francisco. Rates were great, and we booked several rooms here due to its close location to the Moscone Centre.Location - excellent just a half block away from Union Square! Convenient to walk anywhere downtown, or hop on a cable car, although not in walking distance to Fishermans Warf. Also just a few blocks from the metro station, with dozens of restaurants nearby.The lobby is elegant - you can feel the history when you enter, and their sherry in the evenings is an interesting feature.I lucked out with a room on the top floor facing Post Street. I wouldnt say there are any good views here, being San Francisco with skyscrapers surrounding it. I say lucked out as there was no-one above us, so we didnt have any foot noise above us, which others experienced.Rooms are tiny - think of European style with limited room if you have two double beds. Very limited space to use the desk, and if youre sharing, youll have to stack your luggage somewhere to be able to walk around. Same applies to the bathrooms, with some limited space.For summer, there is NO air conditioning. The only way we survived was to keep the window open and deal with the street noise - although there was a ceiling fan. However, it only moved hot air, unless you opened the window.Rooms have modern conveniences - flatscreen TV, fridge, etc., but I was told by the front desk staff that they wouldnt drink the water themselves. Meaning bring lots of bottled water, as the in-room Smart Water is quite pricey.There is no gym in the hotel, but apparently one close by - not sure about it, as I just elected to run outside.Hotel staff are friendly, the location is great, and Im sure its a nice location for a romantic trip - but not the best for business, or sharing a room.
365	2	Not a very well kept place. Cockroaches had fun traveling around the room and bathroom. Owner thought it was her right to park in the handicap parking because it was convenient for her. Coffee pot did not work. Will not return.
366	5	Firstly, I'll summarize my experience at this Hotel... Impeccable Service, Cleanliness, Quality, and Prices. The staff I encountered during my short stay, that I'd like to point out and highly reccommend.... Front Desk Staff Members Denise Pat Angela Reggie Housekeeping Edith Cruz Doniesha Gladys(Asst Supervisor) All of which I'd personally reccomend, and would surely hire(all with management positions), at a... More
367	5	Loved the updated decor of the hotel, inside the lobby and the rooms. Very clean and comfortable. I enjoyed the option of a late check out. Staff was friendly as well. We arrived very late...3:00 am and were offered a late check out thank goodness. I would recommend this hotel to others. It is also in a central location.
368	5	I came back to visit my family for the holidays. This hotel is very friendly and welcoming. The front desk girl remembered me from my previous stay. My room had a desk, microwave, and refrigerator and floor space to spread out.
369	4	This hotel was everything we wanted it to be, and the price reflected that. We paid 448 per night for our room, which I have never done before-HOWEVER this was my sister's birthday treat and we wanted to do it right. Plus it included breakfast for 4, so you can take about 60 bucks off right there. I felt welcomed and like the staff truly enjoyed having us there. What a nice place, even for one night. Not sure if they can do anything about this, but there are a lot of vagrants/homeless that camp out right on the grass in front of the pool. Just was a little awkward, but it might not be the hotel's property.We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us, happy birthday to your sister! We hope to welcome you back again soon.
370	4	Can't be much closer to the ocean, listening to the waves as you sleep. Price is right, clean rooms with great parking. Only real flaw, new carpeting is needed. When booking request the quiet side or next time we would preferably book the rooms right on the boardwalk, worth the extra money. Great location for a lot less cost. Patrick was very friendly when we checked in. Went the extra for making our stay as great as possible.We are one of the few properties in San Diego that gives guests the ability to listen to the ocean waves from their rooms! Many guests also report seeing dolphins from their balconies. Were happy you could enjoy this.Also, the next time you stay with us every room on the property will have new carpet! This process is currently underway and will conclude by the end of February.Thank you for the kind words about our staff, your compliments will be passed along. Thanks for staying with us!
371	5	If its a beach stay in San Diego stay here. We reserved a partial view room with 2 queen beds( mum, dad and 2 girls 6/5) and wow they delivered. Our room was huge, bathroom a great size and a cute little balcony where we sat out and watched the sun set over the ocean. We were not over looking the pool which I was grateful as in the afternoon it was very busy.The hotel is located right on the boardwalk, and a few minute walk to the pier. It is surrounded by lots of bars and restaurants and only a short drive to Sea World ( 8 mins).Breakfast was included in the price too which included waffle maker, toaster, cereals, muffins, fresh fruit, juices and a coffee machine. There is a tv in the breakfast room which was nice to be to catch up on some news. After breakfast we had a short play at the beach before returning to the heated pool. At this hour ( 9.30 ) we were the only ones there. We met a very helpful young man who was placing the towels on the pool lounges. He was full of information about the local area.We really wish we could have stayed a few more days, we felt relaxed and at home at Ocean Park Inn , we will be back for sureIt sounds like you had a wonderful vacation! Our location is quite ideal for families, as we are very centrally located in both Pacific Beach and greater San Diego - great for easy drives to SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo, Safari Park, and Legoland! We're happy you took advantage of our complimentary amenities, and thank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review.
372	5	Location could not be more perfect than this hotel. In the middle of Pacific Beach on the boardwalk, right on the beach. Rooms are good, clean and great customer service. Plus for pool and hot tub which is great for the kids. Highly recommend.Thank you for taking the time to write us a short, but very sweet review. We are delighted that you enjoyed our property and our prime location. We hope to welcome you back in the near future.
373	5	Ocean Park Inn is in a great location in Pacific Beach, with plenty to do in the immediate area. It seems to be one of the few hotels right on the beach, and it was just a few steps from our room to the sand. Its a very clean hotel, and the staff is very attentive and friendly. We definitely plan on being back.Thanks for leaving such a nice review! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us and all of our amenities and found our staff members helpful and resourceful. We hope to have you back soon! Thanks for staying at the Ocean Park Inn.
374	5	Our first time staying at the Ocean Park Inn. We have walked by this nice hotel many times while visiting our son in Ca. We usually stay at a resort up the street but decided that since we were only going to be in town for one night let's try and stay on the ocean. What a wonderful surprise! Room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom appeared to be newly remodeled and quiet nice. Front desk clerks that checked us in and out went out of their way to make us feel very welcome. Loved the fresh fruit upon checking in. The parking garage under the hotel was a plus! Can't wait to return in the fall for a longer stay.Thank you for your kind words, we are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us at the Ocean Park Inn! We are looking forward to welcoming you back in the fall!
375	5	Loved this hotel, great view, great location, great pool. great staff. Next to tons of restaurants and a bike ride to the amusement park. Had a blast! The front desk even checked us in online for our flight! Also the free breakfast has lots of options. Would definately stay at this privately owned property again!Thanks for leaving such a nice review! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and found our staff resourceful and helpful. We are happy to hear you enjoyed all of our amenities as well as all of the restaurants nearby. We hope to have you back soon! Thanks for staying at the Ocean Park Inn.
376	5	I recently stayed here while vacationing with my significant and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. We had a room with an excellent view overlooking the boardwalk and beach. It was great to sit out on the balcony and be able to enjoy the view and action down below. The hotel and room were clean and up-to-date. The bed was extremely comfortable with quality linens. The location was decent, located along the boardwalk with a number of restaurants, shops, and other hotels. Once we were there, we didn't have to drive anywhere since there was enough to keep us entertained close by.The only downside was that it was a bit noisy at night. There were a few people from the nearby bars yelling on the sidewalk, but fortunately it was brief and not late enough to wake us up. Also, the waves were much louder than we'd expected while trying to sleep, but that wasn't the fault of the hotel. Might be something to keep in mind if you are looking for a beach-front hotel. However, overall it was a fabulous experience!Thank you so much for the great TA review! It is great to hear you had a good time in Pacific Beach and enjoyed your room.On your next visit, if you'd like to be placed in the more quiet area of the hotel, please include it in your notes sections when booking your stay, we apologize for the unwanted noise level.We hope to have you back soon! Thanks for spending time at Ocean Park Inn.
377	5	I stayed at Ocean Park Inn in 2008 and 2009. I walked up and down the boardwalk and I don't feel there is a better place to stay. I was on the 3rd floor with an ocean view each time. It is breathtaking at sunset.The hotel was in the process of upgrades during my last stay. My room had not been updated yet - it was in dire need of new bedding I will admit. The bed was quite uncomfortable. The TV was out dated - they were replacing them with wall mounted flat screens however. They were also painting all of the hallways - I see someone mentioned the hallways were not air conditioned - I don't spend time in the hallway, so I don't see why this would matter - I never noticed the hallways being uncomfortable.I used the pool area quite a bit to tan, and was usually the only one there. Pool area is great.I have read some reviews stating that the management and staff were rude, that the area is noisy, and there are people hanging around the hotel. I had absolutely no problems with any of the staff on either of my stays. Each one was consistently helpful, courteous - almost to a fault!, and friendly. Jay, Chanel, Patrick, Sachin and Karelia - made my stay all the more enjoyable. The hotel is on the Pacific Beach boardwalk - there is noise. There are people on the boardwalk, rollerblading, skateboarding, biking, walking and jogging from early morning to evening. The beach is also immediately off the boardwalk - what do people expect! For there to be no one on the beach and no one on the boardwalk If you want quiet and solitude, stay on an island. It's Pacific Beach, it's a beach community - it is what it is. I never found the noise to be over-whelming and slept with my slider open every nite.Yes, there are a number of homeless that stay directly in front of the hotel on the boardwalk - they keep to themselves and don't bother anyone. I never saw them approach anyone at any time. They are gone by early evening. Traveling alone, I never felt afraid to be near them at any time-in fact I talked to some of them. They are harmless. T The continental breakfast changed last year and didn't offer as much as it did the year before (there were waffle makers the year before). However, there were several varieties of fresh bagels, packaged pastries, toast, butter, jelly's, cream cheese, fresh fruits, cereals, coffee, juice and milk. Just like any other continental breakfast FOR FREE. I'm just not sure what people expect. It was quite adequate. I would rather not have a full breakfast offered in lieu of keeping costs down.Again, having walked up and down the boardwalk, there are some really trashy places to stay - including the Best Western that are old, outdated, filthy and run down. Yes, there are a few nicer places like Tower 23 but the cost is also considerably higher. For the money, location, rooms and staff, I can't think of a better place to stay while in Pacific Beach or the San Diego area.
378	5	My DH and I recently stayed here for our anniversary. We are a local couple who just needed to get away for a night. The staff of this hotel was one of the best parts. I cannot remember the name of the front desk attendent when we checked in - maybe Michael But he was great - very helpful on where to dine and drink. He also told us all about the breakfast offered at the hotel and all the other nice ammenities (free breakfast, one of the NICEST pool areas in all of PB!). The room was clean, the bed comfortable and the view was SPECTACULAR! The otel is small which we prefer. It is quiet right on the boardwalk close to great food and nightlife. In the morning we drank our coffee on our balcony and watched the waves roll in. It was an amazing anniversary and one that will not soon be forgotten thank to Ocean Park Inn's great hospitality. We will be visiting again when we can get a night away fron real life!We're elated to hear our hospitality made your anniversary trip so enjoyable and memorable! The staff is also very happy to know you noticed how clean the pool and surrounding area is - our head engineer treats the pool like his own and is very proud of it. We look forward to seeing you for many future anniversary trips!
379	3	OPI's actually encouraging people via email to write TripAdvisor evaluations even though they're undergoing renovation of their bathrooms. I'm a little surprised since I can't really rate this stay as high as I have in the past, due to ongoing construction. Anyway, I stayed here 4 nights at their 99 construction rate. Can't beat the rate, though you will have to tolerate workmen pounding away on things all day long, including Saturday and Sunday. However, they didn't start too early in the morning. And there's a fair amount of dust and sharing of the (slow) elevator with construction dudes rolling away carts of material to dump. I had a side room for the first time - not as nice as the ones that look out over the pool to the beach, but it put me farther away from the construction noise so I didn't really mind on this trip. As always, P.B. can be a wild place on the weekends -- good or bad, depending on what you're looking for -- but be prepared.Thank you again for another review! We're happy you've become such a loyal guest of ours - and although this year you had to deal with some extra noise and dust, the goal of our renovation and updates is to give you even more value for your next stay with us. As always, we look forward to seeing you again!
380	5	If you want to be at the beach this is the place to go! Located near bars and restaurants in a nicer section of Pacific Beach. Good family atmosphere. Quiet area. Continental breakfast is a nice bonus.We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us, we love being on the beach as well! We hope to welcome you back again soon.
381	5	My husband I went for a quick beach getaway. Friendly staff, clean room (although small), beautiful ocean view from balcony easy beach/shopping/restaurant access. Woke up to the sound of the ocean as we kept our balcony door open. We stayed on 2nd floor, it is a bit noisy from the boardwalk traffic down below. It did quiet down as the night went on. Other than that, we had a great stay.
382	4	We loved the hotel. We had a large partial ocean view. Our room set back 20 feet from the strand. The whole ocean views are right on the strand which might be a little too close. They offer toys and chairs to take to the beach. Also underground locked parking. In ocean beach it is almost impossible to locate on street parking. The staff are wonderful. The hot tub and pool are just the right temperatures. We also loved the balcony. You can really hear the ocean from there as well as just sitting on your very private balcony. You really don't need to rent a car. Everything is within walking distance. We will definitely stay there again. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience and what the hotel have to offer to the TripAdvisor community. As I'm sure many will find this information very helpful. We are delighted to hear that you will be staying with us again, hopefully sometime soon!
383	4	Stayed there for 5 days while on a business trip. There isn't a minibar(fridge) like other Hamptons in the area, but was not a bad hotel. Its clean and quite and overall pretty good. Its not within walking distance to anything, but an HEB is not too far away if you have a vehicle.
384	5	Tim, on duty during our check in, was fantastic! Went out of his way to make sure we were totally satisfied. Our flight from SC to McAllen was supposed to have taken a total of 6 hours. Because of problems with American Airlines, it took over 14 hours. We were exhausted by the time we got to McAllen. Couldn't get... More
385	4	This is my 4th or 5th stay at this location and it has gotten better with time. Recently renovated and much cleaner and newer now than when I first stayed. Unfortunately, they seem to have also increased the price a bit since my first stay and this was unwelcome as the price was important to me in choosing the hotel.We at the Best Western East Inn Suites wanted to thank you for giving us feedback regarding your recent stay with us. Our staff is proud to know that each time you have stayed with us your experience has only gotten better, and we hope it will continue to do so. We do apologize for the increase in price, but we it was necessary since we have renovated our property. However, we do enjoy having you as a guest, and we do hope to see you again at our establishment soon.
386	5	Good customer service , room clean, quiet , nice are but one thing difrent information on site than what they give you on the phone. Just need to be careful next time. And have a little more smiling workers.Thank you for choosing our property for your most recent stay. I appreciate your feedback and I'm glad that your stay was enjoyable. I do apologize for the misinformation that you might have received and I would really appreciate it if you could provide me with the site that you referenced, that way we can fix any discrepancies. Again thank you for providing us with your feedback and we hope that you choose our property again.
387	5	a friend of mine stayed at this hotel with our kids. Brandon helped us with getting our room, he explained the aaa discount to us and was very friendly. He told us of all the services that the hotel provided. On our second stay, we came during a busy time for the hotel. Brandon told us that the there were no nonsmoking rooms available. He upgraded us to a suite, and gave it to us at the same rate as a standard room, and we were able to use the aaa discount as well. Our stay was wonderful, we didn't have any issues. The staff is very friendly, and willing to help with any questions or assistance needed. Its also in a great location, as my friend lives in Titusville its convenient , as she is able to get on the freeway and get to work on time. We now refer to the hotel as our hotel. I am the type of person that I usually would pay more to stay at an embassy suites. I always thought that best western was like a days inn. Brandon and the staff have helped to change my opinion of best western.
388	4	This hotel was an excellent choice as the location was near Orlando Sanford International Airport just a hop and skip away. The hotel looks nice and is very clean. The staff go over and beyond to help you with anything you need. One of the maids got me hooked up to the internet when their computer was offline, I joked that she should be paid more for being their go-to IT person! Fantastic breakfast!Dear Rhea S.,Thank you for providing us with your positive feedback. We're happy to hear that our property helped to enhance your stay. I am thankful to have a great team to work with and I will make sure to recognize them and their hard work at the next meeting. We hope that you will come again soon.
389	5	Staff was very friendly, the breakfast was real good there was a lot to choose from, room was clean, bathroom was clean the only thing that was wrong in my room 227 is , the shower needs more water pressure, it took me twice as long to take a shower due to how slow the water was flowing.but over all I was very satisfied with my stay.Thank you for providing us with your feedback regarding our property. I'd like to start by apologizing for the inconveniences with the shower, I will take your concerns up to our general manager. On the other hand, I'm glad that the rest of your stay was enjoyable and we hope that you will choose to stay with us again.
390	4	Older hotel. Always clean. Staff is always pleasant. Todd at the front desk must have a stash of happy pills. They will eventually loose Brenda at a high pay waitress job, as she can do it. She and Greychen. do a great job with breakfast. Always clean. Always friendly Thank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback. I'm glad that our staff was able to enhance your stay with us and I will make sure that Todd, Brenda, and Gretchen are all aware of your review and are acknowledged at our next meeting. We hope that you will stay will us again soon.
391	4	Older hotel but very clean. comfortable beds, breakfast was great. our room was very clean. pretty convenient to restaurants and UCF. Hotel was under a little renovations (painting and taring of the parking lot) but this did not interfere at all.Thank you for providing us with your feedback. I will start by apologizing for any inconveniences you may have experienced during your time with us, but we are recently undergoing some updates and renovations to the hotel. On the other hand, I am glad that the rest of your stay was enjoyable and we hope that you will choose us again in the future.
392	5	Great hotel very clean on a busy street nice pool area very clean rooms and convinient to all areas of Orlando. Staff was very friendly.

394	5	I am currently a resident of Louisiana, and I am enrolled in graduate school at Asbury Theological Seminary in Orlando, Florida / Wilmore, Kentucky (2 campuses). I have been coming to Orlando about 4 - 6 times a year for on-campus classes, and I have always stayed at this particular Best Western on East Colonial Drive. This hotel has been perfect for my commute and the accommodations are exactly what I need. The staff are not only friendly but very helpful, and this has been consistent for the last year or two that I have been coming. With this particular visit, the hotel had recently upgraded their internet services but since my computer is aging I was having trouble getting it to work properly. One of the maintenance techs Joel Baez helped me troubleshoot it for a good 30 minutes before we threw in the towel on the wireless and he provided me with an ethernet cable. Problem solved and I'm back online! Thanks Joel B.! Thanks Best Western for always being there when I needed you to be!Sincerely,Stephen HebertThank you very much for giving us feedback regarding your recent stay with us at the Best Western East Inn Suites! We are ecstatic to know that you have been staying with us for some time, and each time your stay was met to your satisfaction. We are sorry if you had trouble with the internet, but it was great That Joel was able to stop by to help you with the issue. We are always working hard to maintain satisfaction for our guests, and we will be sure to acknowledge Joel at our next meeting for assisting you to maintain your satisfaction with your stay. We always enjoy having you as a guest, and we do hope to see you again at our establishment soon.
395	4	Very clean, simple place. I have never stayed at a motel / hotel as nice accepting large dogs . Room was very clean and staff very friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise. What a value and pleasant stay.Thank you for taking time to provide us with positive feedback you experience during your stay. I'm happy to know we exceeded you expectations. We hope to see you again soon.
396	4	Todd the front desk was very professional. Rebecca spoiled the clients like a mother hen. These two employees are really asset to that place where they work. I will definitely, recommend that Best Western Orlando East inn suites. Overall everyone was very nice. The only thing that was lacked over there was an excercise room.We at Best Western wanted to extend our thanks for providing feedback regarding your recent stay! We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay, and that Rebecca and Todd were able to enhance your stay with us. We will be sure to commemorate these two great employees for going above and beyond for you. We do apologize for not having an exercise room, but that is something we are trying implement either into our location, or with local gyms. However, we do greatly value you as a guest, and hope to continue to keep Best Western in mind the next time you need a place to stay.
397	5	Hotel is nice and clean staff is very friendly rooms are very clean and big. Micro and ref. In room .we came here on business and parking is OK. Not really a lot of food near here. But what matters to us is friendly staff and size of the room . The breakfast is really nice also great coffee there was eggs and sausage, they had sausage graveyard and biscuits . The sink was didn't work great and Joel maintained guy came right in and fix it give him a 10 .We at the Best Western East Inn Suites wanted to thank you for giving us feedback regarding your recent stay with us.

We are proud to know that you were satisfied with our staff, room, and the breakfast. We enjoyed having you as a guest, and we do hope that we will see you again soon!
398	3	Hotel could use some renovation, but it was convenient for my purpose. The staff was friendly and the room was as clean as you would expect a hotel room to be. 2 major needs: the toilet seats need to be upgraded to larger size and the hot water needs to be regulated better. I had to take my showers in phases as I waited for scalding water to subside every 30 seconds or so.

408	5	This was our 2nd stay at PACIFIC SHORES INN. Last January we visited and booked again this year because we were so delighted with the property. Travelling with two small dogs can be difficult and staying here made it quite easy. There is a reasonable fee of course, but everyone was kind and open to their presence. We had 3 adults staying in a ground floor room with two queen beds. There was plenty of room, the room was clean, there was a frig, coffee maker and micro wave. Great place to travel with young children. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful, housekeeping staff was cheerful and available to help with extra towels, etc. What more could you want from a beach front hotel with the most beautiful winter sunsets off the San Diego coast We wil be back soon!!First, I would like to thank you for taking the time to write this review. I am also glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and of course, your pets are always welcome here. We are one of the few properties that do accept pets and we know many by their names. You also mentioned the sunsets, where everyday is a unique experience!!!! That never gets old, and is one of the perks of managing this property!!
409	5	I loved my stay here! Friendly staff, rooms were clean, and it's right next to some of the best restaurants. It isn't far from the beach either. John referred us to many great places and was a big help. We are thrilled to hear you loved your stay! Thank you for choosing Ramada Limited San Diego during your recent travels.It is always great when our team members receive recognition for their hard work and friendly demeanor. Your kind words will be passed along!Come back any time!
410	5	Great accommodating staff at the front desk. We had a very specific need for a first floor room and they bent over backwards to make it happen for us when the hotel was basically already full of folks already checked-in. Great shower and super clean, modern room.
411	4	I used to live in San Diego and remember this area as filled with street walkers. I'm glad to report that the area has been cleaned up. The motel is very nice and comfortable. I like the tile floors. WiFi is speedy. Free breakfast is cereal and pastries.Welcome back to San Diego! It sounds like things have changed for the better. We are glad you trusted our accommodations to provide you with the comfort you were seeking. It is great to know our WiFi worked appropriately and you had a chance to take advantage of our complimentary breakfast. Thank you for sharing your positive comments with us and we hope to see you again during your next trip back to San Diego.
412	5	They've updated their rooms so it's brand new everything and also the bathroom is nice and spacious and clean. The price to me was reasonable per night. I'll definitely be staying again!!! Also, the have free breakfast in the morning. The guy at the front desk was so polite and very down to earth which made this an easy experience.
413	4	We were advised well in advance of our stay that there would be a power outage. We decided to stay anyway since we would only be sleeping. We were provided with push lights upon check in. Very clean room! The wood look tile was a welcome change from dingy carpet.Many thanks for your kind review of Ramada Limited San Diego/Near SeaWorld! Our team believes in being proactive and we glad you felt our advance preparation for the power outage was quite professional. With that said, it's great to know that our immaculate accommodations and tile floors met your expectations for a pleasant stay. Your thoughtful praise means a great deal to us and we'd love you to visit us again.

What I didn't like... More
415	3	Location wise this place is perfect. But rooms were small,walking areas and elevator also very small. Front counter service was good. Staff was helpful.Pet friendly hotel. Bit pricey compare with the other hotels in a same area. Rooms does not have microwave or refrigerator .
416	3	Perfect location great food staff is wonderful very kind and will to go the extent mile with in walking distance of shopping beautiful view of the lake from balconies. Beach bar is a nice touch restraint over the water perfect for sunset dinner
417	5	Staff was ok,nothing special. Our room was cute and cozy. I loved the fireplace and that we had beach access from our back door. Overall it was a nice relaxing place that I will definitely be back to enjoy.
418	5	This place was great.. relaxing.. and kid friendly also. My family and I enjoyed out time there and it was really a lot of fun. The food was excellent and it was all very well priced. My family and I will be back during the summer months.

420	3	This was a very inexpensive hotel my coworker and I booked, not knowing the status of the area.The staff was friendly, which helps when realizing what sort of neighborhood it's located in.The pros: it's a cheap hotel, the Bart transit subway is not too far of a walk. Busses are on all surrounding streets. You're surrounded by many different restaurants of all varieties of ethnic and American foods.The rooms are large and the beds are comfy. The room thermostats don't work well so good luck with controlling your room temperature.Ice machine is in the garage but easy to get to.The ConsElevators are slow.The rooms are extremely thin so, if you don't mind noise and traffics orchestras, then you're good. Don't book here if you want silence or scenic views.It's an area of vagrants, homeless, and transients that may make you wary of wanting to wander around in the evenings. It didn't bother me but I could see it for those who can't handle it.I can sleep through anything so, I was at home.The WIFI works and I've not had problems doing work. Hot water is great when taking a shower.If I had a choice to stay here again, I'm might, but make it the last resort.Walgreens is only a block up to get last minutes sundries. Several coffee shops are available, and there are close nearby markets to get beer or cigs.None of the vagrants ever bothered me and I did not feel unsafe like a few of the other reviews I've read prior to booking.I did feel that this hotel can be better if the owners took some money and time to repaint, upgrade the plug in outlets, and added some affordable bathroom upgrades. More importantly, you're in SF, let this place be where you sleep, and enjoy the wonderful city.:)
421	4	The people who run this place couldn't be nicerThey explained exactly which areas to avoid after dark, and what we need to see in SFFollowing the lady's advice, we had a great timeNo rooms were on the ground floor and there were security measures for lift access, so we had no qualms about securityThe room was impeccably clean, and we even witnessed them changing the sheets before the second night of our stayLack of A/C was a bit of a problem as it was unusually hot during our stay, but that shouldn't be an issue most of the timeBed was comfortable, shower was excellent, and they give you lovely soapWe discovered a great place for breakfast - the Olympic Flame CafeIt's about a 10-minute walk towards Union SquareWalk to Geary Street and take a right. The cafe is on the right, opposite the Adagio Hotel (fancy architecture) a couple of blocks before Union Square
422	3	San Francisco is ridiculously expensive city for accommodation. We picked this hotel based upon its price within TA. Its an easy walk from the Bart Station but walk up Polk St!It is in a sketchy area of San Fran. Polk St during the day is fine and you should be ok using Van Ness at night (we were on several occasions). There is also a CVS and Walgreens up Van Ness for basics. No rooms on ground floor and the elevator is the only way up and only staff can buzz you in the door to use the elevator so you are completely safe.Rooms basic. Very basic but clean although a refurbishment would be good. Theres an Ice machine and esky/cooler that you can use free of charge to take to your room. Wifi worked ok. Limited airflow in rooms since no air con or fan. Had to ask front desk for a fan and they seemed a little offended to be honest.You will hear all kinds of stuff at night from further down in the Tenderloin but you will sleep fine. For the price it is kind of a rough deal compared to basically anywhere else in the world, hence the rating. But for San Francisco at a budget rate, its ok for afew nights.
423	5	If you want to simulate what your life would be like if you were captured by a band of terrorists and the room you would get, then you cannot beat this hostel. The front desk and kitchen/common area are clean and staffs are helpful and courteous. The elevator is kinda old and interesting too, be sure to check that out. You can also meet fellow inmates whom you can make friends.Rooms and stairway are small, squeaky and smelly, and lights works half of the time, just as in horror movies. Washroom have no toilet paper and toilet may lack flushing lever/button. If you are lucky you can find one that had both but have no lightbulb so you must take a dump in the dark. Shared shower for men have plenty of hairs and body tissues, with not a drop of running water...maybe the shared shower for females had better luck.In term of value then I would still recommend this hostel, because front desk services are good, and that you should not whine about living experience when you pay below average in SF.
424	2	The one who checked me in doesn't know how to smile, the whole building is showing age, even the beds are showing age, the elevator hasn't been changed since they built the building, you will get a free pancakes if you wanna stand for half an hour and sometimes for more than that, bathrooms are not so clean, the lockers are located only on the first floor and you can use it if you have your own padlock, location is great,
425	1	We have traveled extensively prior, and have stayed at many hostels of similar price range, this one however, is a whole new experience for us. At the check in, the staff opened not with the availabilities of their facilities, but with the offer of free alcohol, every single day. What they didn't say, was that the staff themselves drank most of the free booze, and were hungover most of their shifts. The were more interested in sharing their drunken antics rather than providing any help to the customers. There was only one girl Billy who spoke English (and she's the least useful one out of them all), the rest of the staff spoke very little English and had trouble understanding us.The free alcohol turned lots of the hostel guests into violent drunks, who threw knives at each other in the kitchen whilst cooking.Hostel was extremely noisy and was impossible to sleep without earplugs. The mattress was creaky and filthy, and we didn't even dare to cover ourselves with their blankets, on which we had presumed was dried blood.
426	4	I've stayed twice at this property - both times while running business meetings. I've been quite impressed with the staff's level of service. Their energy and attention to details have made a big difference in ensuring the meetings were successful.The hotel's facilities are well-designed and well-maintained. And while it's hardly a glamor spot, it's a VERY good choice for business travelers. It's actually quite a pleasant surprise!Dear BobRosenNY, thank you very much for taking the time to write about your visit's with us, we appreciate your business. I'll be sure to pass along your kind words and we hope to see you again in the future! Wishing you safe travels. Dieter Heigl
427	4	Stayed here while I was taking my ABEM oral boards which are given on the 6th-8th floors of the hotel so location was really convenient. 7 min free shuttle ride from O'Hare was nice. Facility itself is dated but very well kept and almost everything has been updated. Breakfast is 19 for buffet but very good. Decent workout facility. Walking distance to a couple diners (and Gino's East) but other than that you need to find a ride.
428	4	great comfy hotel, nice outdoor pool, friendly staff and amazing breakfast buffet. Only complaints are the lack of vegetarian dishes on the main menu and the only main course they have is inedible, and the pool would be better if there was a bar or coffee shop next to it where we could sunbathe and order a drink or a snack. apart from that my stay was epic and staff are so helpful!
429	4	Have stayed here many times in the past....imagine my surprise at the grand renovation! Can't beat the suburban location, V V Comfy beds. Airport noise not so bad with the fan on in the room. Great staff...do they give the, happy pills! can't wait for a return trip. Great value and location. Thanks!
430	4	Spent the weekend here. What I liked:- Good size rooms and clean with standard toiletries- Check-in and check-out process was smooth.- I did not order room service but looked at the menu and the food did not seem outrageously pricedFollowing are concerns in the hotel:- the conceirge lounge is not open on weekends. Was given a separate voucher for breakfast but you still can't get water, soda, or snacks in the evening.- the room did not have a fridge- this is not downtown chicago and charging 32 a night for car parking seems quite high- swimming pool is a combination of indoor and outdoor. The same and that was not encourag
431	4	The hotel is all suites, so each room has plenty of space. The access to the airport train makes this very convenient, and the airport shuttle will drop you off at the transit station if you can't make the walk of 4 blocks.
432	2	Unfortunately was a somewhat terrible stay. Right from the get go was warned that the systems were down and would have them up again soon. Was told about other amenities and directed to the room. Come to find out walking by the pool that that was out of order as well. With no wifi since their systems were down I headed to the bar and got a bite a drink. I think everyone was there since no one could get wifi or go to the pool and everyone charging their rooms. The next day at our tradeshow event the wifi was still in and out and their systems were still down. Overall pretty disappointing experience with all of the amenities unavailable. Hopefully they figure it out!Thank you for your feedback, and we apologize for any inconvenience you experienced. Unfortunately, Marriott did have a system outage caused by the hurricane that affected several hundred properties during your stay. We worked very quickly to resolve the issue, though, and our system was back up in less than 24 hours. We truly value your business and hope that you'll give us another try in the future. Thank you for choosing Marriott!
433	4	5 minutes from Ohare and with a shuttle running every 30 minutes to and from the hotel. This is a nice property for a quick lay over. My room was very clean and staff very hospitable. Concierge level on 11th floor was stocked well and the food provided in the mornings and evenings was top drawer. Not much close to this property. Very nice grocery store about a block from the hotel is within easy walking distance with prepared food and good grocery selection.
434	4	I have to be honest that from the outside, the hotel seemed a little scary and outdated. Once inside, however, it was one of the most modern Marriott locations I've stayed in. The lobby area was welcoming and there were plenty of areas to hang out with colleagues in the evening. And the rooms were equally modern and larger than average. My only complaint was that the bathroom was extremely small. I highly recommend this location for small business conferences given its proximity to the airport. The shuttle came in very handy for conference attendees.Dear BFR1920, thank you for taking the time to write your experience while staying with us. We appreciate your comments and hopefully will see you again soon. Wishing you safe travels, Dieter Heigl
435	4	This Marriott was selected for me as part of our partner meeting. After flying in from Miami, having a shuttle to get us to the hotel was a nice touch. Although some complained that it took too long for the shuttle to arrive and get them to the hotel. That was not my experience. Within five minutes of arriving at the shuttle stop, we were on our way with a very friendly and polite shuttle driver named Joseph. Upon arrival, and before checking in I had an excellent meal at the Brickton Grill located in the lobby with my partners. Upon checking in, I found a room that's a bit on the small size but definitely functional, clean, and comfortable. There were plenty of outlets to charge my electronic devices, plenty of drawer space and closet space to unpack, and the desk was perfect for work. The workstation and office chair important to me and my business travels. I thought that the Matt did a great job with the room. The bed was very comfortable. I will also note that the service on all levels was very good. The location in Rosemont not very far from the airport makes this an excellent place to stay on business if you don't need to be in downtown Chicago.Dear Maltafaz: Thank you very much for writing a review of visit with us. I glad that you enjoyed your stay as well as your dining experience in Brickton and Brickton Bar. We look forward to your next stay! Wishing you safe travels, Dieter Heigl
436	5	The hotel has been thoroughly modernized and is great and very fresh. The size of the rooms and bathrooms in the main hotel is great. We did not stay in the of the rooms out by the pool. There was a slight issue when checking in as we called in the morning and requested connecting rooms as we had a 3 adults and 2 four year olds and a two and a half year old. When we checked in we were taken to the 9th floor first and no connection then to the 10th floor and no connection and then down to the 3rd floor and found connecting there. Kyle the bell hop was great and stayed with us on the radio so we did not have to travel up and down with cart and kids. They handled it well and resolved it quickly. Kyle did an excellent job of taking care of us. The only thing I would say is questionable is the pool area in the indoor area floor. The floor is very slippery and dangerous and we were quite surprised when we were there that the hotel has not done something to change that after all the money they spent on the remodel.Also had a bit of trouble everytime we left parking lot with room keys and the parking kiosk. Took several times and a buzz to the inside to get the gate up. We were not the only ones, everyone we came across was having trouble exiting the hotel parking lot. Maybe they should come up with a new system. Laundry area was nice and very clean and bright. They may want to considering adding one more of each machine as they have only one now, but it was a large room with plenty of space and very clean. The restaurant breakfast buffet was excellent and the staff in the restaurant and bar area were very good.The business center was great with new computers and a great printer. Would definitely stay again.
437	2	I would never stay here again. The food at the basic breakfast buffet was good and the front desk was nice BUT the rooms were terrible. We were notPut in the tower but in the low rise Motel 6 type section. Bathroom was extremely small. (Door will hit your knee and you can touch the ceiling with the palm of your hand). Our rooms overlooked the pool and their was a connecting balcony along the outside of all rooms overlong pool. Did not like that feature or the bright lights kept on all balconies thru the night and the curtains poor design allowed for a lot of light tocome into the room. Sheets were too small for the bed and didn't even cover the mattress. Carpet on stairs to our floor was years past its replacement date. Walls thin. I could hear hairdryers etc in next room, kids having fun in the pool and planes from O'Hare at night. It was NOT a peaceful stay. For the cost of a Marriott stay you get a Motel 6 kinda roomDear Wendy Z,Thank you for taking the time out of your day to write to us about your most recent stay. We value your constructive criticism, without your feedback we would not be able to learn and grow in our quest for excellence in guest service. We hope that if you find yourself in the area again you'll give us a chance to make it up to you. Wishing you safe travels!
438	4	We booked this hotel as we are Marriott Rewards guests needed 9 nights of parking while down in the carribean. Our son daughter in law met us at the airport, so shared the room. We had a nice dinner drinks in the restaurant before retiring for the night. Our flight was at 5:30am, so made arrangements for the shuttle at 4am, which worked out well! Upon returning we did have difficulty with our parking ticket getting out of the parking lot...Parking is not in a covered, so had to clear our car of a little snow. Overall, a very nice experience!Dear Karen B - Thank you for being a loyal Chicago Marriott O'Hare guest. I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your most recent stay with us. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future. Safe travels.
439	2	The hotel is very rundown. I was very disappointed. The mattresses were terrible you could feel Springs
440	5	Went for a short trip to Orlando, hotel was great, had a pool side room, clean room, good job housekeeping, staff were great
441	1	Rioms were nasty nothing work properly. Out dated television, no refrigerator nor microwave in rooms then everyday rates goes up, as if thier offerring something for the amount of money veing spent. Didnt appreciate the false customers services front mgmt. He would make promises that he didn't keep. Very unhappy with my stay then he the mgmt would treat you like a dog. Didnt earn not one singke free stay after staying straight for 14days abd paid over 700. Too much extra from hotel and Wyndham rewards very misleading.
442	3	Pros: can't say enough about the location. walking distance to restaurants, convenience stores and pharmacy. Minutes like 5 minutes top to universal. 6 minutes to the giant ferris wheel. Stayed here before and can say they have started some renovations that were much needed. Check in was easy and check out as well. Water pressure was amazing. If you are here for the parks and not be in the hotel much it would be perfect match. Cons: rooms are not noise proof. TV was out dated. more repairs are needed. It's improved but needs more done. The motel can not help how other guest act but I cold see they were monitoring a couple in a huge fight that everyone could here. I had my phone ready to call 911 if need be. No bar which was a bummer. The in house deli wasn't anything really. I decided to eat breakfast else where after that. With Denny's across the street and ihop in walking distance it was no biggie. I had an inside hallway near the pool it seemed a bit more quiet but felt isolated. If your in need of a budget friendly and aren't picky about things it would be a match. If you have kids its not bad and are on the conscience mind its perfect match. Most kids don't care as long as there is a pool.
443	1	Location is the only thing this place has going for it. The door didn't seal, the curtains didn't cover the whole window, the towels were so threadbare you felt like you were using paper towels, and the power outlets were so loose my charger kept falling out. The staff was friendly enough when prompted but didn't go out of their way. I also had to pay a 50 deposit that has not been returned yet.
444	4	Hi, I bought tickets from the internet as a package with this hotel without reading any reviews in the first place. howver later we did ) and we was yeah.. scared and even chocked about others reviews. We got in touch with the travelling agency and there was nothing to do, abosolutely nothing what so ever. Hmmm.. We searched the internet and found even 200 dollars per night with bad reviews, hmmm. We my wife and I agreed upon that we would show up on our already paid stay at Days Inn and we did)! We arrived and had two pool side rooms situated on the 1st. floor. We basically invented the rooms and searched the rooms for roaches and bugs as described in previous posts. We found it very nice, comfortable beds, Wifi which worked all our stay for 15 days ). The pool was also amazing clean and house keeping was effective every morning (Hard working latin americans.) I can only tell that I didn't expected such a good service and clean place - we were ready to leave directly, but we were surprised, really!! Great place and no danger for children, we had 3 kids with us on 17, 14 and 7 years old. Absolutely no problem, respectful environment and no dirt as claimed earlier. If this place was situated in Italy, people would expect this older style. I have seen worse places in europe where its accepted because of its location on a hill side etc.
445	1	VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!Wrong decision. The very same night we arrived I found 4 roaches in the bathroom. Horrible smell.!After 1 hour I was changed to another room with 1 roach.I was told the hotel was booked.Unsafe elevator, buttons missing, had to use the stairs. Old building, noisy A/C, leaking refrigerator, wet carpet.ROOM 546 544Be carefull before booking,
446	1	Coming from Texas I booked online and checked all the pictures available before and it was good. But when I got there this one was terrible specially considering that it is a prime location for tourism in orlando. Walls were peeling off, very dirty, sink was not working neither the hair dryer. No refrigerator or microwave, when I went downstairs to get ice, machine does not work either. Black mold in the shower and lamps that did not work. Original carpet was replaced without removing the sides showing old carpet. At the website they say free wifi and breakfast.... Free wifi yes but no breakfast.
447	1	The staff were horrible!!!!!!! We told them there were bed bugs on our pillows and we have photos and a video to prove it!!!!! They treated us as if we brought the bugs with us!!!!!!.Yes,they changed our room but rented the room to someone else .We will never stay at this hotel again and will share this story to everyone The manager never contacted us !!!!!!!
448	4	the only thing about the hotel it was dusty plus the AC dripped water outside and my dad that is 75 years old fell because it was slippery which i didn't like that at all he got his knee scraped all.
449	1	This place needs a complete restoration. Ceilings and walls have patches everywhere. The room smells like mold. The towels are like sandpaper. Bedding is stained and mattresses are sagging. The tub is dripping. There are plenty of cockroaches. I could go into more detail, but then I might throw up.
450	1	Filthiest hotel I've ever stayed at. Room service didn't change the sheets once during a 5 night stay, they only replaced towels. Door didn't close properly allowing loud noises to enter room 24/7. Phone and alarm clock didn't work. Half the lights didn't work. Literal holes in wall, peeling paint. Disgusting.
451	3	The place is ion a good location, staff is friendly but no refrigerator or microwave, so if you are planning to stay more than one night just know that you will be spending a lot of money.
452	1	I can't believe this was a days inn. I tried to book a days inn near the convention center, and that's the location I clicked, but somehow it booked me at this location. Where to start... no phone, lamps didn't work, sheets didn't fit the bed, patched up tiles in the bathroom to cover holes (and none of it matched), exposed electrical outlets hanging out of the walls, housekeeping didn't clean anything (not even the toilet) during my stay. My rooms door had been pried opened, and hammered back to seal the door, Worst hotel I've ever been at.
453	1	There is no fridge, no microwave, no hanger. The safe isn't work. My trip was a disaster they do not serve any breakfast. No more please stay away
454	2	Room had a yucky smell, lights did not all work, each day we did not receive towels, workers at the front desk were not very pleasant to deal with and once we arrived, the rate went up from what we was quoted! Will not be staying there again!
455	3	Aunque el hotel en sus instalaciones esta completamente nuevo, el servicio de limpieza pasa solo cada 8 dias! y aseo general cada 15, queda lejos de todo, no tiene piscina, creo que para una emergencia de ultima hora funcionaria bien porque no veo ningun servicio que valga la pena resaltar. El precio es lo llamativo del lugar.
456	1	I stayed ONE night, before I could get my bag out of the car, I was propositioned twice, and three times asked if I wanted to buy drugs. Then in the room it looked like one of those rooms out of a horror story, dried blood on the sheets roaches crawling on the floor, Seeing we were new to Florida... More
457	5	I wanted to visit Woodstock on my big birthday. looked for places to stay and this popped up with great reviews. This hotel was reason enough to celebrate in the Catskills! WE traveled from MA for the weekend with our two daughters and this hotel was the highlight of our trip (for all of us). No need to travel to... More
458	5	I was a little tentative to come here because we usually stay at another hotel we really like. We were picking our daughter up from college and this hotel was just what we needed. The room and hotel was clean and it was quiet. The breakfast was good. I would recommend gettng some sugar free syrup.I have to say, I love the staff at this hotel. They are REALLY nice people. Steven at the front desk is very nice and I can't say enough about Brian Knopp. We were moving our daughter out of the dorm and she had extra activities she was involved with and it was leaving us with little time and we didn't know how we were going to manage it. In talking we Steve, he said he could give us an extra hour at check out , but not only that, they let us come back later in the day to freshen up before an event we had to go to. I had asked to use the public bathroom, but Brian wouldn't have that and let use a vacant room. We only needed it for about 30 minutes, so it worked out perfectly. We were so grateful for the hospitality they provided.I would come back to this hotel in a heart beat.We very much appreciate and value your feedback and will share it with our team. Your survey responses will serve as encouragement to all of our staff as we strive to continuously improve the quality of our services to provide an exceptional experience for our guests. It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback.Thank you again for sharing your experience, and we look forward to your next visit!Safe Travels,Brian Knopp, General ManagerCOMFORT INN SUITES - LynchburgA New Level of Comfort!
459	5	We checked in on Friday 11/6 thru 11/8/15. We were pleasantly surprised by your facility. We have never stayed in a Microtel Inn before and we will stay again. We loved our room, it was nice and cozy. Your front desk staff and other staff members were very polite and helpful. The breakfast was very delicious and well maintained. We... More
460	5	What a total gem in downtown Madison! Rooms are elegant and hip, staff went above and beyond any call of duty to make my daughter traveling with me feel very comfortable and welcome at a very fancy hotel. We stayed in a suite and couldn't have been happier--the kitchen was perfect for us and the layout of the suite was... More
461	5	I had no idea a place like this could exist in Wisconsin... The industrial theme (concrete floors, exposed ducts, modern furniture, etc.) made us feel like we were in a loft in Uptown Minneapolis... The ambiance at the hotel restaurant (The Wise) was unbelievable, and the food was outstanding. All in all, this place was awesome.
462	5	Our family has stayed at this hotel several times. It is clean - in our room, the lobby and restaurant. We have also found it quiet at night - despite being on a college campus. The staff are wonderful and you can't beat the location with all downtown Madison has to offer. We will definitely be back!
463	5	Staff are professional pleasant. Rooms are CLEAN comfortable. Quality breakfast provided, with options for varying diets. The heated indoor pool is well maintained. Floor does get slick though! When travelling to Kingston, NY this is the first Hotel I check for room availability!Thank you for the rating and the wonderful review. We appreciate you sharing your comments on our facility and staff. Great that we are your first choice!! Thanks!
464	5	This hotel is like being in Mecca if you're idea of Nirvana is shopping. It is very easy to locate in Seattle. The car valets were helpful and courteous. The front desk staff were prompt. And the concierge, well, he was the absolute best we have ever had. He had suggestions for shows, attractions, timelines, and restaurants. He even made suggestions for what to order off the menus!The room we had was a standard with a small queen. It was a corner room with 2 windows that opened to let in fresh air (yes, you need fresh air even in frigid February). It was a little stuffy without the windows being left open. I would say spend a little extra money and get a deluxe room with a king. The bathroom was also very small and not big enough for 2 people sharing! Definitely need either 2 bathrooms (as some of the more deluxe rooms have), or ask for one with a larger bathroom.However, we didn't spend hardly any time in the hotel as we were out and about so much.The location was ideal. One block from either direction of both Macy's and Nordstrom's (and about 6 Starbuck's coffee bars in a 4 block radius). Plus, just 5 minute walks from other name-brand chains. And close to Pike Place market and great venues like the Triple Door, and fantastic restaurants. Too many restaurants to choose from. All that means is that we will need to go back and try them all out. And we will definitely be staying at the Mayflower Park Hotel plan to make it 'our hotel' whenever we go to Seattle.
465	5	I always stay at this Four Points in Seattle because I am welcomed with a warm smile. It makes me feel less distant from my family and cheers me up after a long day of travel. After only two stays, Abdi remembered me. He greets me by name and introduces me to his colleagues, like long time friends. Outside of feeling at home, this property is modern and well maintained. Has underground parking and gym. It is centrally located to great restaurants, sites and running paths. Enjoy your stay.
466	1	Our family stayed there for one evening in March and were not impressed. The hotel is newly renovated, however the building is quite old. You can hear people walking, talking, running. If you have kids staying above your suite, good luck on getting any sleep. While having breakfast, in the morning, the fire alarm went off, and it was very loud and went off for quite some time, possibly 10 min, we were all looking at each other, thinking what to do, while the staff was walking around casually, there was no direction, evacuation procedure, zero communication. Finally, we asked one of the servers if he knew what was happening, he explained that they will be here soon to fix it. That was it. After we checked out, my wife realized that she had left her gold bracelet on the night table. We phoned the hotel and returned only to find nothing and that the staff no e speak English. Only the cleaning staff has access to a securely card-lock controlled room. We are told basically too bad, so sad. We wrote letter and called the hotel and head office. The same response, sorry, could not find it Basically, the gold bracelet walked out of the room on its own. Very dissatisfied and unhappy. Very unresponsive management. Will not stay there, nor will we recommend it. We paid to stay at a hotel and get robbed.Dear Valued Guest,We appreciate your candid response. I apologize on behalf of Four Points by Sheraton that your stay was not as expected.Yes we are a fully renovated new hotel in Seattle, and I apologize for the fire alarm. When this happened we were instructed by the Fire Department to wait until they arrived to silence it.Regarding your gold bracelet, as we discussed earlier, we did do a thorough investigation looking for this and questioned our staff. The Housekeeper that cleaned your room is a trusted and valued employee. It is unfortunate the bracelet was missing, but were not able to locate it anywhere.I apologize for these situations again. By far, most guest experiences here are excellent and guests are pleased. If we are able to have you back please contact me so that I can personally make sure we take care of your stay.Thank you,Joe AlbertsGeneral Manager
467	3	We had two rooms booked for a post cruise stay at this hotel. We checked in for 2 nights on July 22. When we entered the hotel lobby there were a ton of people either waiting for rooms or trying to check in. It seemed there was no organization at all.I am an SPG member and booked one king room on points and booked a 2 bedroom suite at full rate. At the desk, I was not greeted as an SPG member. I was told our rooms would not be available until 3pm. It was about 10am. I complained a bit and was told the hotel was fully booked the night before and there is nothing available. My group and I decided to book a tour of Seattle to pass the next few hours.We arrived back at the hotel at 3pm and found only one room available. Needless to say, this did not sit well with my group. We were all very tired and just wanted to get to our room to relax. About 45 minutes later, a room was found for us and we were told to head up...except and the other desk attendant said No, that room is set for another person. The woman helping us said that the room in question should not have been given to another party. Now we are mad. Finally the woman helping me found yet another room. I told my party our initial room was given away and that second desk attendant chimed in with no it wasn't. Those other people have been waiting since 7 am! Once we finally received the room key we grabbed our luggage and tried to get on the elevator. What a mess that was! There was a group of folks with a luggage cart filled to the brim trying to maneuver it onto the elevator. It was too heavy for the elevator so they were stuck half in and half out blocking up the hallway! Finally we got through and went up to our room.Our room was the 2 bedroom king suite. It was a nice room. Unfortunately there was a big iron mark in the rug but it was clean. There are no phones in the bedrooms. Only one phone on the desk in the living room. The room was spacious and comfortable. There is only one bathroom. It has 2 doors, one opens to the main living area and the other opens to a bedroom. One problem in the bedroom was the door stop for the bathroom door is right by the bed where you step when getting out of bed! That is a design flaw that really should be corrected! The bath was large and clean.As usual in the Sheraton chain, the bedding is fantastic! Overall, the room was great for what we needed. It slept the three of us comfortably. The location is good to the Space Needle. The area is a bit rundown but there are some places to eat, which we did not do. I would stay here again if they work out the delays in check in. In the meantime, if you are staying here, I suggest you request a guaranteed early check in time to avoid the hassles we endured. I did explain all of these concerns on my SPG emailed survey and was pleasantly surprised to be contacted by the hotel manager via email. He apologized for the circumstances and said the hotel is working on the influx of cruise passengers and trying to figure out its policies for check in times. His prompt response was unexpected and completely appreciated! I was also issued some SPG points as compensation. Because of his attention I do not hesitate to recommend this property. It is a fair price in a good location with fantastic beds!
468	4	Seven of us flew into Seattle relatively late in the day and stayed overnight at the Four Points. The next AM we were able to use a meeting room to prepare for our business meeting in Seattle (walking distance from the hotel, in fact). While the hotel does not have a lot of frills but the kitchen was open until 10:00 and the bar until midnight and the staff was both accommodating and friendly. The hotel had a functional exercise room that is open 24 hrs (six pieces of standard equipment and a set of weights) which is adequate for the number rooms. Although ostensibly a tobacco free facility I was fairly certain that one of the previous guests smoked extensively in my room which detracted from my visit as did the noise from the ice machine directly opposite my room. The room in fact was a roomy king with a good desk with multiple power outlets. WiFi was complimentary. All in all the price was right compared to other higher end places in the neighborhood.Thank you for sharing your review. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your experience while staying with us and are glad we were able to assist you in preparing for your business meeting. We take great pride in providing our guests with a smoke-free environment and apologize for any lingering traces of smoke. We will share this feedback with the team to ensure this does not happen again. We are glad you found our team to be both friendly and accommodating and we look forward to seeing you again, Steve. Take care.
469	5	Went there for business, it wasn't the first hotel choice I had but it's what I ended up with.Rooms were very nice, fitness center had plenty of equipment, breakfast was excellent (received free vouchers for that, not sure if they always give those out), had a nice Wednesday happy hour (wing, BBQ, and drinks). The staff was friendlier and responsive than most places I've stayed.Walking distance to the Space Needle.There was a lot of construction and traffic in the area at the time I stayed, but it wasn't a major inconvenience.Thank you for your kind words about your recent stay. We are so happy to hear that your time with us exceed your expectations, and that you were able to take advantage of our Best Brews BBQ! We hope business brings you back to Seattle soon and that you are able to stay with us again.
470	5	This hotel is a great place for business or vacation. The staff is friendly, the rooms are your typical Four Points rooms - standard for the Four Points brand. The suites are really nice, but not worth the extra money as the standard rooms include a small sitting area and a large desk that spans the long wall. The Wednesday night grill they include with the local brews deal is more than enough to make a dinner out of as well. Underground parking is really nice during the cold and rainy months. Within walking distance to the needle, but not near Pike's Market at all, would have to drive to get to that and parking downtown near that area is pretty expensive.Thank you for sharing your thoughts on our hotel. We are thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay at our hotel and that you found our staff to be friendly. Its also great you were able to take advantage of our Wednesday night Best Brews BBQ evening reception. Our convenient location is not only walking distance to the Space Needle, but there is alternate transportation available to and from Pikes Market and the downtown business district, such as Monorail. Plus, our front desk is always happy to help arrange local transportation. These alternative transportation options may be less expensive than parking downtown depending, of course, on how long one plans to stay. Thanks again and we hope to see you soon. Take care.
471	5	Great place, walking distance to good food and the Space Needle. there's a few run down buildings around the hotel but I never felt unsafe. A+ bartender too! Would definitely recommend staying here!!!
472	4	Great location to businesses, shopping and highway. Comfortable with excellent staff. I was there on business and it worked out great.

473	2	The room was a great size, updated and nice. The shower/tub was dirty, and the pool area was nasty, The kids wanted to swim ( which is why we booked this hotel... for its indoor pool) , but the pool was nasty and the hot tub had what looked like sand all in the bottom of it. The chlorine was so strong, we could not even stay.Dear 874reginab,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria feedback. I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced while staying at our Wingate hotel.

474	5	Veronica was very helpful. She searched and found my reservation and secured a room for me. She was pleasant and greeted me by name when I approached the receptionist desk. I felt at home. Dear jdbrownattorney, Thank you so much for all of your feedback. I have shared your review with the entire staff at the Wingate by Wyndham. The Wingate hotel looks forward to you visiting us again. Remember you can Count on Us!!!Tremeil BooneFront Office ManagerWingate by Wyndham
475	2	I normally travel quite a bit and because of a meeting I was attending I decided to stay at the hotel that was hosting it. This is the second time I've been so disappointed with my room. Everything was so dirty . Sink, shower, hair dryer .... so very disappointing. This was my second time staying in a Wyndham and both times I've been very displeased with my experience.
476	5	I just wanted to say that my family and I stayed there about a week ago and we were so impressed with the customer service skills from Staci, she did everything from making sure we had extra towels and face cloths in the room because thats what we noted in our reservation, checking us in early, she called us once we got in the room and settled to make sure the room was okay. She printed out directions every time we needed them and she was just a joy to talk with. She is really good at her position. The hotel overall was excellent and we will definitely return.On behalf of our front office staff we want to thank you for staying at our location. Stacey is one of our best employees. Our Count on Me Wyndham Culture was built on taking care of the guest needs. We believe at the Wingate that our customers pay our salaries and deserve to be served as guests. Please feel free to stay at our location on your next visit to Atlanta.Willis Blake DOS
477	4	Stay was ok ,my problem was when trying to contact general Mgr she never returned my call . We were looking to stay another week and I retch out to to see if we could receive a discounted rate considering we had already stayed 4 days
478	4	Good location, friendly staff. Room was nice and bed was comfortable. Internet was slow so watching TV was difficult, and working on a computer from the room was impossible.

Please feel free to contact us on your next trip to the Atlanta area. Willis Blake DOS
480	1	I literally stayed for a night because I was too tired to continue driving. The point of me stopping was to get sleep. I was next to a room full of kids screaming, jumping off of things and banging against the wall. I called three times to room service. All three times he came up to speak with the children. Needless to say I didn't get any rest. I called and left a message for the manager and still have yet to have heard from him. This shouldn't even get a star Please accept my personal apologies for the inconvenience you experienced with your hotel stay at our Wingate brand location. Although your experience with us has not been a good one, we hope that youwill offer us the opportunity to provide you with our hospitality on your next trip. Thank you for taking the time to let us know of this situation. We do apologize and look forward to serving you in the future.Sincerely,Willis Blake DOS

My husband and I have a certain proclivity towards Wingate by Wyndham rather than other hotels during the Atlanta Jewelry Shows.Dear Mr. Jim M, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback. I will definitely share this information with my entire staff.The Wingate by Wyndham hotel is looking forward for to your next visit to Atlanta please feel free to contact us for any request.Tremeil BooneAssistant Manager
483	3	The staff was superb!! The room, however, was not. It was extremely noisy it was not as clean as it should have been and there were several repairs that should have been made. As an example, one side of the commode was not attached to the floor properly, so when you leaned, the commode went with you! Plus, the safe was locked, so we were not able to use it while there.
484	2	I was unhappy with the service for the room. One nite I had to go to the front desk for shampoo etc. because none were restocked. Then I get ready to shower and no washcloths. Were there. Another trip. We have stayed here for at least 4 years and this was a firstThank you for taking the time to let us know about your concerns with our BRAND. I have discussed this situation with my entire staff to ensure it is not repeated. We assure you this kind of incident is not the way we conduct business. Our goal is to provide a level of service that requires diligent attention to detail and is a matter of constant reinforcement of our hotel. Once again, we are truly sorry for the inconvenience we caused you. If there is anything else we can assist you with in the future, please don't hesitate to call. We look forward to having you as our guest in the future.Willis Blake DOS
485	5	It was great to include the small gym. My only complaint was with breakfast. If you offer service until 9am. Then it should remain fully stocked until 9am not short the main items: eggs, bacon, and sausage.When I asked at 8:45 if they bring out more eggs, bacon or sausage I was told no because it was too close to 9am.William Thank you for taking the time to express your feeling regarding your stay at our location. Our free daily breakfast is a great selling point for our customers. I will meet with my staff on Friday and review your comments and concerns. Please feel free to contact us on your next trip to the Atlanta market.Willis Blake DOS
486	4	The staff were friendly and courteous, the head of house keeping does a great job in making sure the customers are taken care of. The management should think about getting their house keeping department better cleaning solutions for the bathroom tiles are starting to mildew up and there was some black mold starting to form around the top soap dish in the bathroom tubDear Rocky D,Thank you so much for all of your feedback.

487	4	The rooms were great. Breakfast was not well stocked so not much available if you were not there right away! Biggest complaint was both our rooms were not ready at check in! One of them wasn't ready until 5 pm! Not cool after a day of traveling! Dear amyh6751RH, I want to take this opportunity to apologize for the poor service you received during your stay at the BRAND of Wyndham.

491	4	I had a nice 5-night stay at this hotel. I was originally supposed to stay for 4 nights but my flight got cancelled and the hotel, graciously and without hassle or fanfare, allowed me to stay in my same room for an extra night and for the same nightly rate that I had booked when I was making my original reservation online. My room was located on the ground floor towards the back and the only disturbance was the restaurant next door late in the evenings. However, I'm not a light sleeper so once I went to bed, it didn't bother me at all. The legendary cat greeted me when I was checking in (around midnight) and he allowed me to pet him. I only saw him once more during my stay. This hotel is very well located - there are 2 cafes within 5 minutes walk and another 1 about 20 minutes' walk away - and there's a barbecue place right next door, a diner around the corner and a gourmet pizza place across the street. I sampled them all and was happy with my meals and coffee drinks. The hotel serves a continental breakfast. It's nothing to write home about but it will hold you for a few hours and I liked the convenience of not having to go in search of breakfast first thing in the morning. Ponce City Market is very nearby so there are a tonne more food options within easy reach. My room was well kept and very clean. It looks pretty dated but is very well maintained. My only problem was that the hot water took more than 15 minutes to really get hot and since I'm not a big fan of wasting water, I ended up taking tepid/warm showers most of the time, instead of really hot the way I like it. The staff were helpful when needed but not overly friendly. I had a good stay and I would return to this hotel if I needed to stay in that area again. Oh, and there's a Publix behind the hotel, about a 3 minute walk, which was very convenient when I needed cold medicine.
492	4	Stayed here as part of an air - hotel package. The room was perfect except for a very small shower. It was clean and the maid service was good. The neighborhood is awesome, walking distance from many bars and restaurants .
493	4	I was in Atlanta overnight for Christmas shopping in December. I stayed again at the Highland Inn as it is a very good location if you are coming into Atlanta off I-75/I-85. I also enjoy its proximity to Whole Foods and good restaurants and coffee shops. It's also an easy trip up to Buckhead with Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza.My room was again very clean and roomy. This Inn has character and the staff have always been helpful on my three stays.
494	4	I have stayed here 3 time and each time I say to my self I will come back. It's clean they are very nice. each room is very different in a good way.!there is a bar that place music on friday,saturday night and if you get the right room you can here it for free. they did quit fairly early.it is a very friendly Inn!
495	5	Very pleased with my stay at The Highland Inn in Atlanta. Clean, spacious room, conveniently located near several restaurants and shopping centers. Friendly and attentive staff. Loved the cat! I highly recommend this hotel.
496	3	The rooms are quite dated, but clean and functional. I would not recommend this hotel for the elderly or people with limited mobility. The continental breakfast leaves a lot to be desired. It's a perfectly adequate budget hotel and located conveniently.
497	4	Absolutely perfect. I am a young(ish) widow who returned to my roots in Atlanta for a reunion with dear friends two years after the death of my darling husband. This hotel was in a word, magical. The location was ideal, the atmosphere was serene, and the accommodations, although simple and basic, were so appreciated. It was truly my home away from home, although I felt more at home there than I do in my own home. Ive stayed in five star hotels in Europe that I did not enjoy as much as I did The Highland. I will not stay anywhere else ever while in Atlanta, until I move backJulie, Thank you so much for your review. It means so much to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. We hope to welcome you back again soon.
498	5	My boyfriend and I decided to do a quick weekend trip to Atlanta. He has been staying at this hotel for a decade and recommended that we stay here. I'm glad we did. The building has a great vibe to it: old-school, independent, classic. The staff were super nice and always said hi and bye as we came and left. The rooms are fine. They aren't luxury, but we weren't looking for luxury. Bed was comfy, linens were clean. Windows opened, so we were able to have fresh air. Pirate the cat stays there and is super cool, too. I'll definitely come back.
499	4	After returning from Chicago and a stay at the Hotel Allegro, celebrating my partner's birthday, I can't say enough good things about the hotel. While our check-in was a little rocky with a staff member who was a bit terse ( though solely trying to deal with what seemed to be a security issue), overall our stay was great. Staff even had candies, nuts and beer in the room, with a hand-written card waiting for us in our room, as a birthday gift for my husband. The hotel has recently been updated but stays true to its Theater district roots. Modern Art Deco design adorns throughout, while still giving this hotel an old world classy feeling. However, note standard rooms are smaller than the average sizes today, though you will have just enough space to not feel cramp.
500	5	I stayed here two nights for work. This is such a great location - right next to the Chicago Palace theatre. The room was so modern and well light. Loved the decor and instantly loved it. I could also get out of the hotel and walk to a lot of places. Starbucks is right next door - so it was easy to grab coffee in the morning. HAppy hour was awesome - so definitely don't miss it. They had sangria, wine and beer! Overall had a great experience and will definitely be back again!
501	5	This was my second five-night stay for business. My room this time was a tad bigger with more shelving in the bathroom to accommodate my toiletries. This was a HUGE plus. Traveling in the middle of winter, the rates are phenomenal for this beautiful hotel and loop location! I'm able to easily walk to and from place of business each day. The staff is always friendly and attentive. The accommodations are above average in every way. The bed is extremely comfortable with high quality sheets. My housekeeper was excellent (absolutely the best I've had) ANTICIPATING my needs. How often does that happenWhat a wonderful review! Thanks for continually choosing our hotel and we look forward to seeing you in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
502	4	From the front desk to the housekeeping staff, everyone was friendly and helpful. The property (especially the lobby area) is reflective of scene out of a classic 40's/50's movie...really cool! You enter through the street level, but you take the stairs or elevator up to the first floor where the lobby, check-in desk, bar and restaurants are located. There are 3 elevators, pretty busy during the 'rush' like check-in and check-out times, but most of the time we never had to wait too long to get into one. It helped that our room was on the 4th floor. Our room was nice, but anticipate it to be a little smaller than most, particularly the bathroom. This wasn't an issue for my husband and I, but had we brought our kid it'd have been tight. Bed was comfortable, and most of the usual amenities that you'd expect are available in the room. We LOVE the bath products...smelled marvelous! Had to request for a few more so we could take them back to Dallas with us, lol! Our room was located close to the elevator and in front of the ice machine room, but surprisingly we were never bothered by noise (and I'm a light sleeper). The rooms seemed sound-proof because we hardly heard the outside traffic noise or even from the loop train nearby. Also have to note that this hotel's location is on point. It is located in the financial/business area so keep in mind that most restaurants have limited hours during weekdays and are closed on the weekends. But we practically walked everywhere--fairly short distances to both Millennium Park area and the Magnificent Mile where you can find everything else. Also, we took the Blue line directly from O'Hare airport, and the Clark/Lake station where you'd get off is a short walk couple of blocks away from the hotel. So convenient!!Overall a very pleasant and comfortable stay. We love Chicago, and hope to return to this hotel to stay due to the lovely service we've received and how greatly located it is to everything. Wouldn't have done it any other way.Friendly and comfortable is what we aim for and we're so proud of our team! The rooms are a bit cozy, which is what you get in a historic 1920's building along with the charm! Come back soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager

In the center of the city close to Reading Terminal market and walking distance to Independence Hall (about a mile) and to Museum of Art 1.5 miles. wear you're walking shoes, but you are also right across from the Septa Line at old City Hall. And speaking of City Hall, what a view! Asked ahead of time for a room and we were so fortunate to look upon the City Hall building with William Penn standing above the clock tower. It is part of the skyline and could see it all the way from the Stadium complex. Best Courtyard I have ever stayed in.Dear BobfinNH,Thank you for choosing Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown during your recent visit to the area. We appreciate your comment that this is the best Courtyard you have ever stayed in. We have a very unique hotel, in that we are in an historic building from 1926 which was completely modernized in 1999 and completed renovation in 2014. As you mentioned, we also benefit from an outstanding location in the heart of the city, with easy access by walking and also public transportation for a small fee. We look forward to having you back with us soon.
521	5	I recently stayed 2 nights at this property on a business trip. My room was nicely updated, comfortable and quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful. Rather than the typical Bistro set up in the lobby for food and drink, there is a full service restaurant and bar. The downtown location is excellent with easy access to multiple restaurant options. This is a good choice in downtown Philly.Dear StevefromKaty,It is so nice to read your wonderful review about your business stay at Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown! We are thrilled that you had an excellent experience, and we appreciate you highlighting our service and location. We would love to welcome you back the next time you are in the area. Thank you, David Kidd Assistant General Manager
522	5	Everything about our 1 night stay was great. The location is very convenient to the train and ideal to take in all the holiday sights. The hotel was decorated beautifully and all the staff we encountered from the housekeeping, front desk, bellhop to restaurant staff was excellent and gave great service. I mistakenly left my credit card at the Starbucks rushing out to catch the train and by the time I got to my destination, I got an email from management alerting me to the fact they had it. One call to security and they shipped it back to me and I had it in two days. Thank you Marriott for a great stay in a great city!Thank you very much for your positive comments about our hotel facilities and our outstanding staff. We appreciate your sharing with us the excellent assistance you received in retrieving your credit card which was left behind. We do hope that you will stay with us again during your next visit to Philadelphia.
523	4	Beautiful location and property. Amenities galore... nice people. Bed was hard, walls thin ( I could hear the guy next door OVER my own husband and teen snoring). As the hotel cannot control the level of sound made by a human snoring, overall, a nice hotel and will likely stay here again.
524	5	Recently rennovated rooms are EXCELLENT - ALL staff were professional and freindly - exceptional free breakfast offerings - breakfast has different hours for weekdays and weekends - Omelette Chef on duty for weekday breakfast !!
525	5	We stayed at Homewood Suites in Macon the night before my daughter's test. The hotel was very close to the testing center. We had a nice room and a very comfortable bed. We enjoyed the breakfast and wish we had taken advantage of the dinner.

We booked this room as we were travelling and I did not check the reviews first. BIG MISTAKE! I would give this place a negative worse than terrible if I could. We had our day in Estes... More
531	5	If you're looking for a romantic, relaxing, secluded place to get away, consider Stonebrook Resort. The cabins are clean and well-appointed. Fall River is just outside your back door and downtown Estes is close by. You can soak in an outdoor hot tub or enjoy and indoor jacuzzi. If you're like me, the option to stay in and enjoy a... More
532	5	My husband and I stayed here in June of 2015. We were celebrating an anniversary and this place was perfect! We stayed in a cabin that just slept 2. The furnishings were chic cabin. It had that log cabin mountain feel. The description of our cabin said it was not river front because it was not directly on the river,... More
533	5	I stayed here for one night only, for business, however I would have been comfy for a whole week here. My room was on the 3rd floor and I could see my car from the balcony. Cool night air from the balcony sliding glass door was nice! The closet was twice as big as most hotel closets. The laundry room... More
534	5	Highly recomended...awesome...best breakfast...close to everything...clean...great pool...staff is really friendly...work out area is big...they have a snack area...definetly the Best Best Western we have staid in...enjoy.We loved reading about your stay at the Best Western Canoga Park. Thanks for pointing out our comfortable accommodations. We are happy to know that your experience was excellent. It was our pleasure to serve you. Sincerely, Mireya
535	3	The hotel is well situated and very friendly staff. The breakfast was exceptional albeit expensive. We didn't have dinner at the hotel but the menu looked good. I don't understand why water is not included in the room charge like other hotels we stayed in throughout our US trip.Dear Sully333,Thank you very much for taking the time to review our hotel. I'm happy to hear you enjoyed your time with us. Our restaurant ANZU is incredibly good hopefully next time you visit us you will be able to dine there!We hope to welcome you back very soon!Sincerely,Danielle OrtegaDirector of Marketing
536	5	Stayed here with my husband who attended a meeting and this is where they booked him a room and had the meeting. From the beginning with the doormen being very attentive, to the house cleaning staff being super friendly, to the clean tastefully decorated rooms, our stay was relaxing. We were upgraded to one of the Imperial floors which has a lounge that offers a continental breakfast and evening hor dourves/drinks. This was nice as it was easy to grab a bite to eat/drink. The rooms were clean and modern- had a separate tub and shower. There was a screen on the mirror in the bathroom that had it's own remote but we never were able to figure out how to work it (there were no obvious instructions). Wifi was free and the basic was adequate, although you could upgrade to faster speeds if needed for a fee. The gym/pool was an extra 25 for the length of the stay and we did not partake and chose to exercise outside instead. Nice location- only 1-2 blocks from the Powell Street BART station, in walking distance to Chinatown, the Ferry Building, Fisherman's Wharf. The end of the line for the cable cars is not far either. I would highly recommend this hotel and would likely stay here again.Dear Grch,Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review about your most recent stay with us. It is wonderful to hear that you enjoyed your time at our property, and that you were even able to be upgraded to one of our Imperial Floor rooms! I do apologize that there were no clear instructions as to how the built-in T.V. worked in the bathroom. We are always looking for ways to improve the guest experience, so I will absolutely be sharing your comments with our management team to see if there is anything we can do to make our features more user friendly.Again, thank you for taking the time to share your experience, and we very much look forward to having you stay with us again.Thank you,Dani OrtegaMarketing Manager
537	4	Hotel is loced right in the center of San Francisco. Rooms contain everything you need, bathroom as huge! Beds were nice and comfortable. Interior of the hotel corridrs is a little bit outdated. The staff was terrific. Very helpful.
538	4	This boutique hotel-bed and breakfast is so charming and the decor is beautiful.The lobby is lovely with a big gorgeous chandelier and velvet chairs.I've stayed there 2 times now and both rooms were beautifully decorated with victorian touches that I loved!There was free coffee and tea in the lobby and breakfast in the morning.The Italian restaurant located right off the lobby is cozy and delicious too.Lorenzo was so nice and took great care of my guitar that I left,on one of my visits.They have small rooms and big rooms and 2 room suites.The only drawback for me,I wish it were a little closer to Union Square, but still not a bad walk, and lots of other shopping and food in the neighborhood.
539	1	I can't even begin to review this hotel. This hotel is SOOOOO dated.The elevator has a gate and a door and it doesn't stay open. Try getting your luggage in the elevator, keeping the door and gate open so that you can get in without it slamming shut on you. I just can't believe that they didn't at least try to fix it so that it stays open so that you can get in with luggage into elevator.I have to say it was a struggle to get in. NOT FUN!! The room was clean but very tight. I had a full bed and my luggage was on the other half of the bed. No room to put luggage anywhere but on the bed. Good thing I was on my own. Sink was in the bedroom. We are sorry that overall, you did not love your stay with us. We are pleased to provide clean, comfortable accommodation at a very competitive rate in San Francisco, which is notoriously expensive, and we are sorry that we and our property were unable to meet your expectations. Thank you for choosing to stay here on this occasion. Best wishes, Hotel Management
540	3	Nice, old renovated hotel. Room a little small, very hard to move around the room with only the 2 of us. Pretty cheap for San Francisco though. Wifi very bad, couldn't get a decent connection, kept dropping out. Parking in San Francisco is very bad, so be prepared. Hotel does offer valet parking though, a bit on the expensive side. Old style elevator so a bit hard to operate if your hands are full of luggage. Staff very friendly. Our room key kept not working. Other than that, it was an average stay. Good for the price if you want a place to crash for the night. If you have a lot of luggage, you will need a bigger room, as the king side bed, tv cabinet, bar fridge take up all the room.
541	5	The hotel was clean (but dated) and the staff was incredibly helpful. There was a free breakfast, but it was very minimal. The location is great just a short walk to Ghirardelli, Lombard Street, and the waterfront. The hotel is a great value considering the location and ample free parking.
542	4	Room was clean and comfortable. We had a room that was designed for disabled person and this gave us the extra room in bathroom which was a bonus, after most of the tiny bathrooms we have had during our trip. Our key kept becoming unusable and needed us to go back down to reception to have it re-programmed which was a pain. Breakfast was very ordinary. The downside of the sleeping was that it is very noisy, lots of street noise on 2nd floor, and an air-conditioner that kept cutting in and out all night. Very low signal for wi-fi although it did work.
543	2	The rewards side of being a Choice Privileges member is wonderful. It doesnt get much better than to be able to stay for free when travelling. But the downside was experienced this last weekend at the Econo Lodge in Moreno Valley. I chose this location due to its proximity to my daughters residence, just a few miles away. It was... More
544	5	Stayed here in August 2017. Plenty of staff available to help. Pool water was not cold, but just right. Breakfast was contiental plus. Very clean and friendly. I would come back and stay again in a heartbeat.
545	5	Not much has changed.. we have stayed here several times. Same friendly staff that makes me feel at home. Recently redecorated rooms seemed unnecessary, but tastefully done. A nice touch! Staff has extensive knowledge of Island happenings, nothing has ever been too much trouble.
546	4	This is a beautiful hotel situated nicely on the waterfront with clean, spacious rooms with balcony, some waterfront. Food is good. Lobby is beautiful. Large lobby facing the waterfront, tables at top of stairs and a waterfront boardwalk to sit at and view beautiful sunsets.
547	5	We stayed here last year and plan to return soon. We had a three night stay and it was great. Very relaxing--room on second floor overlooking the water. Front desk staff was courteous and helpful when suggesting places to visit and food choices.
548	5	The cleanest and friendliness hotel we have ever stayed for a weekend getaway. The entire property was immaculate and the total staff was most friendly and accomodating. It exceeded our expectations in every catagory and it was a great value. We will return.
549	5	Hotel was very nice, breakfast was fabulous, the hot tub was awesome, room was not as shown in online booking, much smaller but adequate. Not enough parking spaces and cars without handicap tags were parked in the handicap area.
550	3	Looks can be deceiving! Toledo Town Inn is a good stay for fishermen on Toledo Bend. Large rooms with microwave mini- fridge. Boat parking outdoor electrical hookups.
551	5	We loved our stay at this hotel. Staff was professional, friendly, courteous. The hotel is only one year old. Beautiful accommodations. Room clean, fitness center perfect, breakfast delicious. It is only 3 miles from Delta Downs Race Track/Casino. Looking forward to return trip.
552	5	Amazing value! So close to everything in the french quarter, very short walk to Bourbon. We didn't have to ride anywhere, we only walked all week! Great to have a pool. Rooms were clean and housekeeping keeps towels and items stocked. Loved that there was keypad entry. Thanks again for an awesome stay!!!
553	5	We were in New Orleans for Christmas week. Loved every minute! Stayed at the Bienville House, a small boutique hotel on the edge of the Quarter. Gawked at the tourists on Bourbon, listened to live jazz on Frenchmen's, rode the streetcars to the end of each line, and ate ourselves silly. Our stay with Bienville was wonderful. As with any property, the staff make all the difference. Kudos to Cynthia (front desk), Thomas (concierge), and all the staff who worked Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The breakfast is enough to start your day. It is not a buffet. Hot/cold beverages, pastries, cereals, yogurt, bagels muffins are available in a small sitting area off the lobby. Tables are also available in the courtyard. I believe their new bar/restaurant Latitude 29 opens for lunch with reduced prices for happy hour. For whatever reason, the bartenders were less welcoming than the hotel staff, giving us the impression this was just another job for them. There are at least 4 restaurants on Decatur within 2 blocks, including House of Blues. We ate the Star and Evangeline's, both recommended by staff. Huck Finn's is also nearby for breakfast/lunch.These are local places, not at all touristy. Nice restaurants are within 3 blocks as well. As for the rooms, we had a 4th-floor double with semi-private patio riverside. Beautiful hibiscus and palms break the expanse in 3 areas. A 6-foot wall blocks the view of parking lots. The room itself is large and classic New Orleans with floral fabrics, a chandelier, and overstuffed chairs - Bienville is not a modern sterile hotel. The floors creak - perhaps lending atmosphere for its tales of hauntings. All in all, I recommend Bienville House and we hope to return soon.Thank you so much for all of your great feedback! We hope to see you again soon for another great trip to New Orleans.
554	5	this hotel is lovely! tucked away on decatur it is centrally located to anything you wanna do in the quarter. the staff was superfriendly housekeeping included. the rooms are styled old fashioned and the bathrooms were really big in comparison with room size. the sundecks were so pretty that we will definitely stay in a sundeck room next time. my husband and i love finding little gems like this in the city. definitely a romantic place too.We are so glad you had such a great stay!! Please come back and see us again soon for another great trip to New Orleans.
555	4	I loved our stay at the Bienville House. We had a 4th floor, patio room. The patio was cool, with lots of lush plants and a small table. The room was comfortable and as expected for NOLA not large. The 3 of us had plenty of room. The staff was a bit of a mixed bag but overall nice. The front desk staff were super helpful and very sweet, the valet was great and the departing bell hop as well. The bell hop on arrival seemed pretty stressed. He was the only one working and it was a busy time when we arrived. Also, the lady at the continental breakfast was a bit off putting. You could tell she didn't like the fact I like to fix my own coffee. :) The pool is a great little pool in a nice courtyard. Bienville House is located in a great New Orleans locations. It is an easy walk to Jackson Square, Bourbon Street or Riverwalk. I'll be back! Oh, the lady in the next room seemed alarmed when there was loud music playing upon arrival. One should not expect silence anywhere in the French Quarter. It was simply a Riverboat playing load must and passed withing 20 minutes.Thank you for taking time to review our hotel. We are thrilled you loved your stay and enjoyed your room accommodations. We will be sure to pass along your comments about our staff and will look to improve this aspect of our hotel in the near future. Come back and see us again soon!
556	5	Stayed February 2015. Hotel is beautifully decorated and nicely furnished. Service is impeccable with professional, courteous staff. Cynthia at the front desk is lovely. (Please tell her that Mom and Daughter said, 'We'll be back again, okey dokey' She'll get it.) Bienville House is now our hotel of choice. Thank you for a lovely stay!We will definitely pass along your message! Thank you so much for choosing Bienville House for your New Orleans stay. See you again soon!
557	5	Great classic hotel ambiance with modern amenities and the perfect location. So much great stuff within walking distance and the gorgeous courtyard, heated pool (it was nearly hot tub level heated, which made it enjoyable despite 60 degree temps!) and tiki bar helped add to the experience. Lovely furnishings and friendly staff.We sincerely appreciate your positive feedback regarding your visit. We'd love to have you back for another luxurious stay at Bienville House!
558	5	The hotel has a great location. The staff is great. The room was very nice. The bed was good the shower was good. The room was quiet. The hotel has a fast start breakfast. It was excellent. They have juice, toast, bagels, cereal, yogurt and fruit. I would stay here again.We sincerely appreciate your positive feedback regarding your visit. We'd love to have you back for another luxurious stay at the Bienville House!
559	5	Great , Centrally located Hotel Near the French Quarter, Recommend it Highly, It was our third Stay and we will probably never stay anywhere else while in New Orleans. we had three rooms this trip and four the last trip. they are always very accomadating.We love our patrons at the Bienville House! Thank you for your continued support of our hotel. We look forward to seeing you again soon!
560	5	My family and friends come from all across the United States to stay at the Bienville House every August. It is our yearly celebration of my father in-law Paul Helm's Birthday. We are always greeted by familiar faces who welcome us with big hugs. We feel like family when we come back each year. We've worked with management to reserve a room block each year. It has always been a good experience. This beautiful hotel is ideally located in the French Quarter, walking distance from Bourbon St, The flea market and so many of our favorite hot spots. We love to relax by the pool before we head out to another fun filled night in the Quarter. A couple years ago my husband and I renewed our wedding vows by the beautiful pool and then followed by a second line through the French Quarter and reception in the breakfast room. There is just so many wonderful memories made there!We value our patrons at the Bienville House, and are thrilled you have made so many wonderful memories at our hotel. We look forward to seeing you again soon!
561	5	We stayed for 7 nights at the Bienville House in New Orleans over Christmas 2011. The stay was wonderful! We were able to switch rooms to one with a view of the Mississippi and to be able to see the ships and even the Natchez cruise by our window was great. The only concern was the street noise at night but it was the holidays and the French Quarter was full of visitors so it was sort of expected. This boutique hotel was decorated very nicely, the king 4 poster beds were exceptional and even the continental breakfast served from 7:00 - 10:00 am was pretty good. I would definately stay here on a future stay.Dear crdonahue, Thank you for choosing the Bienville House on your recent trip to New Orleans. We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and look forward to your return.
562	4	The Bienville House has the perfect location for a visit to New Orleans, close to the action in the French Quarter, but not too close. Added to that is its incredibly friendly and helpful staff, including everyone from the person who helps you with parking your car, to the ladies at the front desk, to the maid who cleans your room. The balcony rooms are especially nice and look out onto a patio with saltwater pool and a view of the river in the distance. Overall decor is about what one would expect for a hotel that refers to itself as boutique. However, now to the but. The beds in the balcony rooms (where we stayed) are double, and soft to the point of sinking when one climbs in. They are most uncomfortable and should be replaced with queen-sized beds to match the wall-mounted headboards. The room coffee maker is about as minimal as can be found in any hotel, and the coffee and condiments provided are truly weak for a city that prides itself on its fine coffee. The daily ration of two packets of Twining tea was a nice touch! On leaving the elevator area, the halls to the rooms are stark, grey and unadorned. The word drab comes to mind. The biggest shortcoming we found at the hotel was the continental breakfast. Cold, stale bread, bagels and muffins do not constitute a continental breakfast, even with the added, but limited, selection of yogurt and cereal. We are certain that some of the same slices of bread appeared in the bread baskets on each of the four days we stayed, but hopefully we are mistaken. The person taking care of the buffet was very friendly and worked hard to take care of guests at breakfast. Unfortunately, she apparently didn't realize that the gloves she wore the entire time she was working were meant to be changed when performing different tasks. The same gloves stayed on no matter whether handling coffee cups, putting out food, clearing tables, or picking up items off the floor. An explanation regarding proper sanitary technique is in order. So, as said in the title, this could be a great little hotel, but it just needs some work.................Thank you for taking the time to comment regarding your recent visit to New Orleans and Bienville House. I regret that you did not receive the level of service we are capable of providing and I apologize. Your remarks are well taken and have been brought to the attention of our management team for review.We greatly value your patronage and do hope that you will reconsider and give us another opportunity to display to you the type of hospitality and service upon which our reputation is based and which you have every right to expect.
563	4	Never have stayed here in our 20 or more trips to the Quarter, but would book with them again. Rooms are a great value during the week and go up on weekends. We got a good deal through Iprefer. Did not visit the restaurant, but it did not look very busy.
564	5	This hotel was clean, quiet, and very comfortable. Room was spacious, beds comfortable. Staff very friendly and helpful. A little farther from the freeway road noise than the other options, and price was better, too. Good location, near shops and services, WalMart. Very good breakfast. Will return and choose this hotel again.
565	4	the motel was not prepared to serve breakfast to the number of people staying there. the slide is a nice feature to the pool area. it is old and needs some maintenance. the lobby area is very inviting and the refreshment table is homey.
566	2	Reviews had this place rated excellent, not in my opinion. The decor is out of date and the room wasn't clean other than the high points. Other than the walk way in the room the floor was dirty and had stains on the blanket as well. The breakfast didn't have butter for the waffles and not much to choose from.... More
567	5	We were recommended this hotel from several groups of friends that have been there before. Let me just say they were spot on. An outstanding hotel with great friendly staff right on Waikiki beach. The room was huge with plenty of room for a family of 4 ( 2 teenagers ). Close to great food and shopping. Will be staying there again. Aloha Brett1975 and Mahalo for taking the time to compliment our hotel and give us five stars. Im delighted to read that you enjoyed your huge room and that it accommodated your family well. I am glad to read that you found our location and staff to be outstanding. Until we meet again- A Hui Ho!
568	4	I stayed here for 6 nights. It is a beautiful hotel and the rooms are pure luxury. I wasn't impressed with the outside bar as far as service goes but they had a great deal for breakfast (only 7) which is cheap for Honolulu. The only other complaint was that in one of the restaurants in the hotel that has a bar you couldn't eat there. You had to sit at a table. I was traveling alone, therefore, I like to sit at a bar and have something to eat. It is in a safe neighborhood compared to some of the other hotels. If I want to make another trip one day to Honolulu, I would definitely go back there.
569	5	This is the third time we have stayed at the Reef. We stay in partial ocean view rooms and twice stayed in the Ocean Tower and once in the Pacific Tower. Both are very nice and rooms and hotel are all newly renovated to a high standard with quality furnishings. The hotel has great restaurants, The Shorebird, Ocean House and Kani Kapa Grill. All have beautiful food and great ambience. The pool is good and clean and of course you are literally on the beach which is a lot quieter than at the main Waikiki beach. The Boardwalk shops and restaurants are a few minutes walk away and have a great selection of shopping. Recommend these restaurants - Cheeseburgers, Ruth Chris Steakhouse, P F Chang as well as hotel restaurants. A walk up Diamond Head is worth it and the submarine tour which leaves from the Hyatt nearby. Hotel is beautifully decorated and the rooms and restaurants etc are great. We will stay here again. We recommended this hotel to other friends who enjoyed their stays here as well.
570	5	Very clean, friendly and accmodating. Stayed overnight to catch an early flight. Complimentary shuttle on time and well cared for. Coffee available 24 hours, breakbast bag to go before continental breakfast was available. Very nicely remodeled room. Updated and attractive....CLEAN! Super comfy beds and pillows.
571	5	Stayed on recommendation for convenient airport shuttle service. Was very pleased with everything else about our brief stay. The girl at the front desk wen out of her way to ensure we understood the extended parking procedure. Breakfast was great.Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are glad you were very pleased with your stay and our staff. We definitely look forward to serving on your next visit to Philadelphia.Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn By Hilton Philadelphia Airport!
572	2	I spent two nights here on what was a VERY busy weekend, due, I imagine, to any number of colleges ending their spring semesters. The hotel was jammed with visitors and because I arrived late in the day, I got what must have been the last room, even though I had had a reservation for several weeks. I was put in a handicap-access room on the first floor, which was spacious and seemed quiet due to its location at the end of the hall. However, at 7:45 am the construction crew started working in the room directly over my head and I was awakened by the sound of someone scraping the floor above my bed. So much for sleeping in for a late work day ahead...I complained by phone to the front desk and they apologized and promised to move me for the second night of my stay. Two hours later I checked in at the desk to see if I could move before I had to leave for work, but was told that the hotel was again booked solid and they would see what could be done. At that point, I got angry and mentioned that I had requested the change hours before, I am a Hilton Honors member, and anything else that I could think of that would persuade the agent to make the change. She did point out that the renovation work was posted on their website, and there was a printed apology in the lobby, neither of which made me any less sleepy...She finally found a room on the third floor, which was above the floor being worked on, and I moved. It was a nicer room. HOWEVER, bright and early the next morning (Sunday) the sounds of a power nailer wafted up through the vent in the bathroom. Luckily, I had to be at work early that day anyway, so I was already up. If you are booked here, try to get as far from any renovation construction as possible. Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are very sorry that you werent happy with your guestroom during your recent trip. We try to accommodate all reservations but occasionally we cant meet every room request. Your feedback is important us. Were very sorry for the noise issue you encountered in the morning. Your comfort is our number one concern, and we appreciate that you brought this to our attention. Your review will help us correct similar issues in the future. I would like to hear more details on your stay. If possible you can contact me at Jessica.Jones2hilton.com. Our renovations are now completed and we hope that the next time youre in the area, youll consider staying with us again.Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport!
573	4	We booked an overnight stay at Hampton Inn in December. We usually stay at the Renaissance when we stay near the airport, but that hotel was booked, so we found the Hampton. We don't regret it one bit! We would definitely stay here again.Check-in was prompt and the staff was friendly. Our room was ready immediately upon arrival at 3PM. We got a room on the 5th floor with a nice view of the city skyline. The room was clean and spacious. We booked at king- bed room with a pull-out sofa bed and all four of us (all adults) slept comfortably. The HVAC unit was very efficient. When we came in there was cold air blowing, but after a slight thermostat adjustment it was very cozy. There is free Wi-fi in the rooms. All you need to log in is your name and room , so that was very convenient. We didn't notice any noise from neighboring rooms, but several doors slamming in the hallway at 5AM did not go unnoticed. I guess one should expect that from an airport hotel, however, since most travelers will be leaving early to catch a flight. An airport shuttle runs fairly frequently, but we weren't flying on this trip so we didn't use it. However, we did need a cab and had the front desk staff call for one. It arrived in less than 5 minutes! For meals, there is a Ruby Tuesday next door. We chose to dine in the city that night. We did, however, enjoy the free breakfast in the morning. Hot food, not just continental fare! The coffee was freshly brewed and the food was plentiful. That morning they served cheese omlettes and turkey sausage but I understand that the menu changes daily.Overall, a good hotel and the price was quite reasonable! We will definitely stay here again.
574	2	6am breakfast (and then that's late) ... an international airport should be at 5:30am at the latest quality of the food was well below normal Hampton Inn standards staff were helpful by constrained by hotel policyThank you for your feedback in regards to your recent stay at the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport. We apologize for the inconvenience that your received throughout your stay regarding Breakfast. We do hope that you will try us again soon if your travels should bring you back to Philadelphia.Director of Sales
575	5	Did not know what to except at a hotel near airport.So glad we choose this one. Excellent stay. Friendly, helpful and professional staff.Room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom was immaculate.Taxi was available at 3:30 am for our trip to airport.Dining right next door.Did not use it , however the pool looked very nice.Thank you so much for telling us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are so glad that you had a pleasant stay. We strive everyday to exceed our guest expectations. We look forward to serving you and your family in the future!Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn By Hilton Philadelphia Airport!Adrian Woods, Director of Sales
576	5	Not only is this hotel one of the nicest value priced properties, every staff member is extremely professional and friendly, especially the shuttle driver, Happy, who bent over backwards to deliver us where we needed to be. He also improved our visit by providing tips on places to see and dine. This Hampton Inn is a great location with a train station to the city or airport less than a ten minute walk from the hotel.
577	5	Super friendly front desk people and the rooms were very clean and updated. Only downside is the breakfast area is small and people on business trips used it as a conference/meeting room during breakfast time.
578	4	Great staff and breakfast, nice rooms, overall good value for price...closet to the convention center. Ideal even for family, not much in the area but only a skip and a hop to I-4 and your exactly where you need to be....Again, management is exceptional at helping to meet your needs.
579	3	The good: The guys at the front desk were great. Attentive, full of information, courteous and smiling. The room (407) was quiet during the night. A free breakfast is always a plus. The coffee in the room was ok. Complimentary water. Bigger frig and TV. A free outlet next to the bed! The price. Good location. Village Inn next door.The bad: uh oh. What's that on the floor Housekeeping left a little souvenir behind. Don't bother paying more for executive room. Small room with only toilet and small shower in bathroom. Sink outside bathroom. Bright parking lot light at night. Told by one employee when I called the hotel that Sea World had fireworks at night so made special requests for Sea World facing room. They didn't. Breakfast eggs were of the powdered kind. No yogurt. (But then again, I can't complain - it was satisfactory and free.) Pool was basically bordered by parking lot. (Nobody used it during my stay.) No shopping within walking distance. I've stayed in new BW Plus hotels and this is not a Plus. Probably wont stay here again. If you found my review helpful, please click on yes. Thanks.
580	4	I've been staying at this hotel for the past 5 years when I attend an annual convention nearby. I could pay more at the convention site but this hotel is conveniently located with free parking. The rooms have been tastefully updated over the years. The beds are comfortable. Breakfast options were good and the coffee was surprisingly good too. I wish there were more restaurants within walking distance. I'll be back next year.
581	3	Can't say anything bad about Sleep Inn Convention Center. Very clean room, comfy beds and good customer service. Breakfast was modest but very good. Served in a small area though so make sure that you're not late. Two important (and I believe useful) notes - there's only Family restaurant close by and a small grocery y store at Gas station.The good thing is that the Hotel is located on International drive and there is a I-Ride Trolley station next to the hotel. There are lots of dining, shopping places, attractions and major sea parks on International drive and I-Ride trolley can take you there for only 1.25 per person. That was very convenient!Not the best shuttle bus to theme parks though (small and full).
582	3	If you need a place to lay your head and rest, this is a great place. A group of us stayed for a competition and enjoy the room. The breakfast was not the best I have had, but it was food. Staff was friendly and very helpful.
583	5	Me and my Family often take trips to Orlando. But usually never get lost lol. But after seaching for our hotel for an hour and asking other hotels for directions to no availe. I stopped in to the Sleep INN and Jean at the front desk was outstanding he took the time to PRINT me a map as well as directions. Saving my family and me valuable time and frustration. He went above and beyond my expectations and definatly will chose to stay at this hotel next time. Many thanks John C.
584	5	We stayed in a great room facing the ocean and from the living room and bedroom you could see the ocean and listen to the waves all night. Great place, nice breakfast, and very large rooms. The staff are amazing and very ready and willing to help. It the kind of place that I would recommend to anyone and everyone. There is a kitchen in the room, but all the nice dinning restaurants are well within an easy walk.Hi Tony W, Thank you for the great review! We are flattered by your comments and glad that our location over the Pacific set the tone for an unforgettable stay. We look forward to creating many more wonderful memories for you in the future. Terima Kasih, (Thank you in Balinese)Dallas King
585	3	First the positives. I was in the new building which was just across the side street from the main building. The view was great and the bed was extremely comfortable. There was a little kitchenette for heating food at night. However the down sides were that the porch by the water was like a fire escape landing and people could go up and down the stairs. No privacy and can't keep door open at night to listen to the water. The room is pretty small for the price. The breakfast buffer wax excellent as wax the beautiful courtyard right near it. No room service any other time so plan accordingly. The bathroom was so small that two people could not fit in it. The staff were extremely friendly and the location is what you pay for. Dear Shaun B,Thank you very much for this review of your recent stay at our hotel. Please accept our apologies for the challenges you faced while you were our guests.We truly wish you would have alerted us immediately about your concerns with your room, we would have tried to accommodate you in another room. We are glad you found our breakfast options and location to be worthwhile.We hope you will stay with us again when you are in La Jolla, in order to have another chance to exceed your expectations, and for you to see we have used your feedback to improve. If youre so inclined, please feel free to reach out to me directly via email at danpaintai.com or by phone 858-224-7600.Thank you,Dan
586	5	This hotel is absolutely perfect. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed. The staff was friendly, greeting me with a tour of the grounds, a description of the neighborhood, and escorting me to my room. The grounds and the room were lovely, exactly as advertised on the website. I stayed in the ocean view studio, which was beautiful, with a gorgeous view of the ocean. The room and the whole hotel is comfortable and relaxing and the perfect getaway.Greetings Sara T, Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. On behalf of the the team, we are all so pleased that you had a perfect stay with us. We all strive to ensure that our guests have an enjoyable experience.

587	5	I've never wrote a review on any place I've ever stayed at before. After staying at the Pantai Inn I felt that I had to do something to say Thank You! Best stay at any place I've ever had. The Staff and service was amazing! Great location with plenty of nice shopping and restaurants nearby. I will be coming back.Greetings newfarmkid,Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn.We are most honored to be your first review! It means the world to both myself and our team that you took the time to share your experience with other potential and longtime guests. We appreciate your need to say thank you following your stay. However, we THANK YOU for choosing us and allowing us to participate in the birthday celebration.Come back and give us the opportunity to WOW you again!Thanks!Mike
588	5	We booked a 3 bedroomed bungalow for our recent family holiday, the accommodation was outstanding, it had everything you could possibly want or need. the beds are super comfortable. It was spotless. The location is perfect seconds from the ocean front and minutes from restaurants and shops. The breakfasts were fantastic, the setting for breakfast was beautiful. All the staff members were extremely friendly and very helpful You will leave the Pantai Inn feeling relaxed and most definitely wanting to return. The fire-pit is a real highlight.Greetings Lgowtraveller,Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. We appreciated that you and your family traveled such a great distance to stay with us. Fortunately, we have the opportunity to welcome guests from all around the world. All of the team here does their very best to ensure that they all feel at home. Thanks you for outlining your accommodations, the amenities that were included with your stay, as well as a bit about the surrounding area. Come back and stay with us again soon! All my best,Mike
589	5	I've visited San Diego area several times. This time, my parents came with us for two nights in La Jolla. My father has limited mobility, so proximity to the ocean and good view from the room were of paramount importance. Pantai Inn is about 5 min walk from La Jolla Cove, where you can go watch adorable seals/sea lions lounging the hotel is far enough from the Cove that you don't hear their nocturnal squawking or smell them.We stayed at a 2 bedroom suite with full ocean view at Pantai Inn. The rooms were luxurious, renovated, comfortable, and meticulously clean. The fully stocked, modern kitchen with a large dining table was perfect, as we ate our dinners watching the sunset. The open air lobby (with a variety of tea, coffee, and daily freshly baked cookies), well-tended gardens, fountain, fire pit, and dining area were all wonderfully decorated with thoughtful small touches. All the staff members we had the pleasure of meeting were accommodating, courteous, unobtrusive, and efficient. Daniel (I think that was his name, apologies if I'm wrong) cordially led us on a tour of the 2 bedroom suites available and let us choose at check-in (1st floor vs 2nd. We chose the 1st floor to minimize navigating the stairs. It also has a sunroom and a more open layout. The view is better from the 2nd floor. However, there is no sunroom in the 2nd floor suite). There was a fresh fruit tray waiting for us upon our arrival. We even received beautifully decorated, delicious mini cakes once the staff members found out that my parents were celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary. It was truly thoughtful and made our stay even more special. We looked forward to delicious breakfast every morning. The daily menu was placed on our fridge the night before.We've made wonderful memories here. I can't thank the Pantai Inn staff enough for giving us a trip to remember forever. This hotel offers top notch service in perfect location for those who want a quiet, luxurious getaway.Greetings CurrentlyReading, Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. You illustrated a beautiful picture of what it is to be a guest at Pantai Inn. We VERY diligently do our very best to ensure that both our returning as well as our first time guests have a memorable experience with us. We have flexible accommodations and we can usually meet everyone needs first floor, second floor, ocean view, two bedrooms, three bedrooms, you name it we can usually deliver. Thank you for outlining the wonderful staff interactions that you had. We truly do have a remarkable team. Each of them give all that they can and do their best to ensure our guests are comfortable. Also, I wanted to let you know how much I appreciated your pictures. Often times, travelers get the impression that images that hotels share are not the true photos from the hotels. Your images capture the essence and care of our Inn. We are looking forward to ensuring that you next stay is just as memorable as the first. Looking forward to seeing you again soon!Mike
590	4	We have stayed at the Holiday Inn Bayside many times before taking cruises. Always clean, great staff and Anthony's Sea Food Grotto across the street. Large rooms as well. The shuttle drivers went the extra mile for us! Would return again!
591	2	I have to disagree. I think the staff in the hotel lobby were not helpful or friendly at all. A young girl one of the days, didn't seem to care less to help me out with the bus schedule or any kind of help. But the shuttle boys, the bayside bar, and cafe servers in the hotel were AMAZING and helpful though!!!! Thank you to all those guys/gals!!! Ask for Steve if you need a shuttle to/from the airport!! :)Well first off we had a pretty long travel with a bunch of luggage. When we finally got to the hotel.. we got directions to our room (which was on the VERY last block of the hotel.. and 2nd floor) so anyways, we went off to find our room, well the directions we got sucked and we got a little lost, and finally we found it (keep in mind we were lugging around a baby, stroller, carseat, 3 huge luggages, backpack, diaper bag) Oh and not to forget that we had to make two trips up and down the stairs to get all our luggage in. We were sweating bullets when we finally settled in our hotel room. So after a 8 hour travel than getting to our room in tim buck two it was just a diaster!! Ruined my night for sure!! But the room was okay. The view out the balcony was better than what i thought!! A great view of the pool and the garden. And it was cool that we got to sit out on the deck. We had a room in the old building, so it was a little old unsafe feeling i had the entire stay. The beds were pretty comfortable and made nicely. The little fridge was in a cabinet under the TV, which had a little odor in it and sat on a stained shelf. I actually have never experience a Holiday inn as a motel before, but this room made me feel like i was in a motel. I would not stay here again... not unless it was for a cheaper price than what i paid. If i wanted a motel feel like room.. i would of stayed at Days Inn for half the price!Dear Kristen386, Thank you for your stay with us and leaving feedback. We are pleased you liked the location of our hotel as well as the view from your room. We take our guest comments very seriously and always strive to provide comfortable and friendly accommodations. Were sorry you received service and room conditions which fell below your expectations. I appreciate your feedback as this is our best resource for improving guest services. We hope you give us a chance in the future to show you how great our hotel is.If there is anything we can do to make your next stay more comfortable, please do not hesitate to ask the Manager on Duty.Sincerely,Jaime WCase ManagerIHGCare
592	5	I've missed this placed soMany times why Always looking for something better ,staff great calamari excellent, yes I had a martini perfect I have not seen this perfect pour since Nyc where I learn how to make a perfect martini. I have travel now for 13 years and this is the perfect martini. Next meatloaf and dessert. Hitting the bed soon
593	4	I returned to Hotel Solamar in San Diego at the end of July for a conference.This hotel lives up to Kimpton's reputation for great customer service willingness to please you and make your stay great.This hotel is located one block from the Gas Light district and the emerging East Village which is gaining a reputation for great new restaurants adjacent to the San Diego Padres ball park.All staff members are on top of their game from the front desk staff to Jesse at the pool bar to Guadalupe the housekeeper for my room and Hormand the manager of housekeeping who served as the host of the nightly free wine and beer gathering in the lobby.The hotel is great for business, couples, families and solo. There was a group attending a digital media conference, a honeymoon couple from Italy, a recently engaged couple from San Francisco and families from all over the country with young children. The SD Zoo is a short distance away and is great for young and old alike.The pool is small but the pool area is large and accommodating for food, drinks and lounging to use pool. I was not there on a weekend so the limited number of loungers around the pool was not an issue.There is nothing not to like about Solamar and I would recommend staying there no matter what your reason is for being in San Diego.Hey Richard C thank you for the great review! It sounds like you had a wonderful visit to the Solamar and we couldnt be happier to see that! Its true we love what we do here, I think you felt that first hand from Jesse, Guadalupe and Holman during your visit. Again, thank you so much for the kudos we are happy you came and hope you visit us again soon! Cheers! Shannon Foster
594	3	We recently stayed for 1 night on a King Corner Spa room overnight on Christmas day. I was disappointed that we did not get a suite upgrade. I was told by the front desk that our room already was an upgraded room, which was not true. It was almost like having Inner Circle status didn't matter except that I got my usual requested amenity. The room itself was decent and in true Kimpton style, Solamar had its own quirks with its nautical theme. It's starting to look a bit dated so hopefully they will renovate soon. The jacuzzi was good but nothing to die for. It was also bad that the restaurant was closed as I always want to try Kimpton's restaurants. I might stay here again but I'll probably consider the other Kimpton hotel down the street on our next San Diego trip.Hi Carlo, thanks for staying with us and for taking the time to post a review. The King Spa Corner room is indeed an upgraded room and our standard rooms aren't quite as large as the King Spa Corner, nor do they have the Fuji Soaking Tub like the one in your room. We have 16 suites on property of our 235 rooms, and they certainly get reserved up quickly. Sorry about the restaurant being closed during your stay. Jsix is an amazing restaurant, although it was time for a quick refresh. The new look is going to better match the amazing cuisine. We certainly hoped to impress you during your stay better than we did on this trip. I hope we get another chance on your next trip to San Diego, as we want our IC members happy at all costs. Thanks again.
595	4	Nicely decorated room with modern furnishings. It has a mini bar with a good selection of drinks to purchase. There is a rooftop pool and lounge on the 4th floor, which is nice on hot days. The room was quiet and an easy to operate thermostat. Nice location in the gas lamp area--lots of night life with in walking distance.Thank you Damon R for the 5 STAR Review! It sounds like everything went perfect with your visit. I'm happy to see that you enjoyed the newly renovated rooms, location and amenities. I hope to have you back with us again when you return to San Diego. All my best, Shannon
596	5	This hotel had it all... outstanding and personable service and quality furnishings (though I understand they are remodeling to make it even better!) Lively complimentary cocktail hour including pub games.Gorgeous pool area with poolside food and bar service and all i an idyllic location in the Gaslamp quarter! Would stay here again and again!Well Angie H...we would love to welcome you back again and again! Thank you for the phenomenal 5 star review! I truly appreciate to taking time to write about your experience. We can't wait to have you back again..hopefully soon! Cheers! Shannon
597	5	This is a true Kimpton Hotel experience--pet-friendly, person-centered--just absolutely wonderful. The first night of my stay, the hotel delivered a cheese/cracker/fruit plate (delicious). A paper was hung on my door each morning. The rooms were clean and quiet. The hotel was conveniently located to the Convention Center and in a safe location! Hotel staff were attentive and wonderful! The wine and beer reception hour (complimentary) was nice after a long day at work and play.Dear KrisG3333,Wow, thanks so much! So happy you enjoyed yourself and I'm very grateful for you acknowledging the hard work of our team. Have a great autumn and please come back soon.RobertGeneral ManagerHotel Solamar - a very Kimpton Hotel
598	5	Located in the Gas Lamp district the Solamar provided the true Kimpton experience. Each and every staff member I spoke with was friendly and helpful. All provided Excellent Service and again the location was perfect. Look forward to staying there on my next visit to San Diego. Ahhhh the true Kimpton experience! Nothing like it! Glad you enjoyed your stay and the staff was superb! We look forward to you next visit too! Justin- AGM
599	4	We stayed at the Solamar as part of our honeymoon last week. We arrived after a long drive and straight away we were hit with 3 big charges. 45 a day to park your car there which seemed slightly excessive! And then one of my biggest gripes with hotels...12 for wifi...I just don't get in this day and age how a hotel can still charge you for wifi. Then after a week of travelling down California we had quite a bit of washing...on average they charge about 6 per item. so it would have been over 100 just to wash a few items of clothing...luckily we found a laundrette on 4th avenue. (and free wifi in a caf round the corner)That's the bad stuff out of the way!Now the good stuff!Great location to discover San Diego. Was a walk to Balboa Park...and a walk to the harbour. They sent us a bottle of Champagne and strawberries in chocolate as a honeymoon gift (the only hotel on our honeymoon that acknowledged our celebration - not that we expect any freebies but it is nice!)The room was great...modern clean and spaciousTheres a nice rooftop area with seating bar and a small poolThe staff were very friendly and helpful.Breakfast is situated at the adjoining caf which was nice.So almost full marks but not quite!First off Lifeshouldbeaholiday, I love your username and 100 agree, life should be a holiday! Thank you for the candor used while sharing feedback regarding your visit with us. So happy to see that our team took such fantastic care of you and congratulations on your marriage! I know those additional charges can add up quickly, we do offer complimentary internet for our Kimpton Karma Rewards members (which is a free loyalty program) and fortunately the free internet with that program is good at all Kimpton hotels. We do occasionally offer exclusive deals for our Kimpton Karma guests as well that include discounted parking, if you choose to sign up, it will certainly help save some money on those additional charges. I hope we will be able to welcome you back again, maybe for your anniversary if not sooner. Cheers! Shannon
600	4	Stayed here for 3 nights with my girlfriend. We loved San Diego and this hotel was in a great location. Walking distance (and safe walking day or night) to the Gaslamp Quarter and to the Harbour. And the street does not get too much traffic so uber/taxi/shuttle pick up and drop off is easy (10 minute drive to the zoo and SeaWorld and Petco Park). The room itself was fantastic. We got a room with a great view of the city and bay. The room was very clean with great air con, comfy bed, and hot shower. I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but I couldn't because of the wifi. It's free, but it was useless. Could not stay connected and when I could it was awfully slow. But we still had a good time and this hotel overall, only enhanced our stay in San Diego. We will be back! (hopefully the wifi will be improved by the time we do ) )EN4C3R- Thank you for your loyalty to the Westin San Diego. We are so thrilled you enjoy our location, breakfast and the Westin Heavenly brand products. We are also currently planning our CAT6 wifi upgrade throughout the entire hotel and will be very excited when this is completed. We look forward to your return to sunny San Diego and getting that 5 star review from you next time!Be Well, Alyssa Turowski, General Manager
601	5	Stayed there for a conference (Great conference area by the way) and found the room spacious, very clean and comfortable. Absolutely love the bed - I have bad back problem and I was able to sleep all night. The food in the hotel dining and bar areas is very good and a little pricey as in any hotel. The hotel is in a central area where you can walk a short distance to the Gaslamp area (a historical area with shopping and restaurants) the bayfront where you can visit the Maritime Museum where you can enjoy hopping aboard sailing ships, pilot boats, submarines and explore the museum or visit Little Italy, and well it is a great hotel with a helpful staff. We really enjoyed our stay.Bobby S - What a great review! I am delighted to see that we exceeded your expectations. We are a perfect choice for business or pleasure while visiting San Diego. Centrally located between the Gaslamp, Little Italy and the harbor, we are walking distance to great shops and dining. Here at the Westin San Diego, we know that great service is what brings our guests back. Our Westin Heavenly Beds are the best in the industry. They definitely help you leave feeling better than when you arrived. Did you know you can purchase the exact same bed at Nordstroms, Pottery Barn or online at Westin at home. We look forward to welcoming you back the next time you are in town.Remain Well,Alyssa Turowski
602	4	I stayed here 8/15/14 and they were able to get me an early check-in which was before 12pm to which i am very appreciative. The room was comfy for a single person. Big comfortable bed. They have those rain shower fixture + a hand held shower in the bathroom. The place is very close to the gas lamp area and to the train station which is what I took to San Diego. The front desk people are very pleasant.RCAlvarez, All of our guest rooms hold the Westin Signature Heavenly Bed and Drench showerhead. We guarantee a superior slumber on our Westin Heavenly Bed. A Classic white bed with 5 standard pillows and sheets, you can relax with ease. Our Drench rain shower and signature white tea and aloe bath products create a spa like essence to further renew your senses. You can take them all home with you from our Westin at Home online store! Thank you for your review and I hope you visit again soon.Remain Well,Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
603	4	I booked a city view room instead of courtyard but maybe that was a bad idea. Everyday we got woken up around 5-6am by ambulance or police or fire truck on the street (and we had a room on the 7th floor!!) We didn't use the pool so cannot comment on that. Location was close to Downtown and sea. Staff was sweet amd acknowledged our wedding anniversary and sent us bubble. Appreciate that. hellkitty, I am delighted you found our location ideal for seeing all the sites that our wonderful city has to offer. Its unfortunate to hear about the street noise affecting your sleep. There is a window vent that often gets left open and when that happens, the street noise is very noticeable. We look forward to welcoming you back for another anniversary getaway. Be Well, Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
604	1	This hotel is falling apart, and the staff doesn't seem to care. The first room we were put in had a broken AC unit, and the room it self was filthy. when I advised the hotel staff, they had me bring in a large industrial fan for the room. It was so loud that we decided we should change rooms.... More
605	1	Run away fast don't bother stopping here..lobby looks nice and that's it.. rooms are dirty toilets are not cleaned. My room had graffiti on the walls.. we even watch 2 drug deals happen within 10 minutes of checking in. We tried to get our money back but the front desk can't issue a refund unless the owner is available to... More
606	1	Good place, good setting, bad management. The property manager will lie, cheat and steal. Be sure to keep your valuables locked in your car. Better yet, find a different place. There are many nice hotels in Prescott.
607	5	Chose this hotel because it was close to the car rental and airport. After checking into the hotel, we returned our car early the night before our flight and Rose, the front desk lady suggested that we then take the shuttle from the car rental to the airport and they would pick us up with the hotel shuttle. What a fantastic idea. No bags to move out of the rental car.The room was comfortable and clean. I think the beds were the most comfortable on our trip. No refrigerator or microwave, but they do have a restaurant in the place that was most pleasant.We didn't use the pool, but it looked quite nice.The noise from the planes was not even heard due to the air conditioner in the room.Thank you very much for taking the time to share your comments about your stay with us. It is our hope that you can visit us again soon the next time you visit Phoenix.Kind Regards,Griselda MenaAssistant Manager
608	4	We loved staying here to avoid a chain and support locals. They keep the place very clean. We had a fridge and microwave. Sat by the pool out front in the evening. Great weather, but a lot of traffic. The rooms are in the back of the property so it was plenty quiet.
609	4	Checked a LOT of different places for our Alabama Trip with my brother and sisters.Motel won out price wise and we arrived and had an enjoyable check in and had a two night stay in room 115.The room was clean and the only complaint there is the front door to the room needed weather stripping around the door as...

610	5	I only wished we lived closer to Newport so I could spend 3 or 4 long weekends a year at Agate Beach Motel. We met our grandchildren in Portland for a larger family gathering and decided to fit in a day in Newport at the beach before heading to Ashland to see the musical Wiz. We were so pleased with...

611	3	We stayed here for two nights. Staff was friendly. Close to Fairgrounds for Jeep Show. Room was clean but sparse. No clock or shampoo but for the price we had a nice stay. No U tums on route 30, therefore not the easiest to get to.
612	5	We enjoyed 3 days midweek,Christmas week, in a Black Bear Cabin. It was fabulous...just what we were looking for. Very cozy, wood fireplace, close to hiking, lots of privacy to come and go as we pleased,and with the availability of the lodge for a special meal or two. We had one breakfast and one dinner at the lodge and it... More
613	5	While traveling back to Illinois from Arizona, we stayed at this Hampton. It is a beautiful newer facility with comfortable beds. It was quiet and clean and the breakfast had a very good variety of foods. An EXCELLENT experience!
614	5	Stayed here a few nights before I moved to another part of the city for work. The architecture, the atmosphere, the decoration...everything is special about this place. Even in my room I could find Art Deco details. My room was compact but big enough, clean and cosy. The bed was good and the bathroom had a large walk in shower. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. You could leave your luggage in a safe place. Breakfast was good enough. The location is amazing. You only minutes away from the Chicago river and some of the famous landmarks like The Chicago Tribune Tower and the London House. Would go there again for sure!Dear KenDB1982,Thank you for taking the time out to review your stay. We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed your time here at The Freehand and that you liked the style of the hotel. We are definitely in a great location and are very lucky to have such amazing places nearby. I will pass on your lovely comments to our staff thank you again for taking the time out to give us your feedback, we hope you have a wonderful day!Best Regards,Kristen JacksonRooms Division Manager
615	5	Went to Broken Shaker on the tip from a friend and so glad we did. The bar is almost hidden in the back of the Freehand Hotel/Hostel in Chicago. It is small and intimate and warm and inviting. There is so much to see in this small bar from the Hand Painted Octopus mural on the wall (and hidden on the 70's wallpaper) to the macram wall hangings. It definitely feels like you are in your parent's basement in the 70's - but cooler. The cocktails are delicious. We had the B*tch Don't Kill my Vibe and the margarita with chorizo salt. Another friend got their famous Cocoa Puff Old Fashioned. All were delicious. We didn't eat at the Broken Shaker on this visit, but saw some food being brought out and it all looked wonderful. We will definitely be back!Hi Casa1234, Thanks for visiting us and I am so glad to hear you LOVED the Broken Shaker. We are so excited to be able to welcome people into our amazing space and we can't wait to welcome you back for some more cocktails and food!!
616	4	Slightly apprehensive at first, but once I walked through the doors, this hotel is the gem of the area. I love the rooms and the fact that one can absolutely relax without flipping on the tube or picking up the phone - you find them. The boutique bar - restaurant is awesome and I highly recommend a bourbon on the rocks with some BurattaHello richardmO9670EC, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I am so glad to hear that you loved your visit and that you found the Broken Shaker to be so amazing. I hope we can see you back again very soon!
617	2	We only stayed one night,a spur of the moment trip. The price was cheap enough, and the young man at check in was nice as well. The room had a musty smell, the towel rack and toilet paper holder were missing and there just two hand towels. We spent the first ten minutes killing flies. Finally, I'm not sure my... More
618	5	Ludlow's is not only a fantastic family destination, it is absolutely Minnesota's best choice for entertaining customers on a spring or fall fishing trip. Without question, they will have an unforgettable experience and they will catch fish!Jack Thanks for your review. We love the spring and Fall Season. It is by far the best time get into some great Walleyes on Lake Vermilion. Thanks for your continued support
619	5	I was very impressed with this motel! Very clean and cozy! Loved it, and can't wait to stay there again. Very quiet and peaceful place for some good sleep. I would recommend this motel to anyone. I'm glad I finally got to stay here.
620	4	Comfortable, clean, convenient but could have done without a very loud snorer in adjoining room.
621	3	Well maintained older retro motel. Nice wood paneling interior. Retro 1953 diner close by. Seemed to be a pleasant place. No lobby. Walls let noise come through. For the price it was fine. We didn't use the outdoor pool.
622	4	This is an old Residence Inn that has been updated. Rooms are condo-style, with 4-8 per building. Second floors have no elevator, but outside stairs. Room was spacious and clean, but smelled heavily of cigarette smoke. However, that cleared up as I got in the room, so it may have been someone recently on the balcony. Bathroom was roomy and... More
623	5	The staff is extraordinarily friendly and helpful. The facilities are pristine and spacious. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone staying in the Asheville area. We were in town to be with a family member in hospice and the staff was so amazing.
624	5	Michelle and Reed were so friendly and really went the extra mile to make up feel welcome. Their goal is go above and beyond what is expected and they did. They have added a restaurant and a latte/cappuccino machine. Yummy! This is worth a visit.

630	2	I stayed here for 2 nights. I read reviews from back in November that it was being remodeled. Thought by now remodeling would be done. Mattresses were comfortable, but pillows are horrible...Very knotty. This place should be closed until remodeling is done.
631	5	it was just what we needed , we were very tired, Hampton is our favorite place to stay, when we are away .the beds are always comfortable. easy parking clean, and new and fresh. always a pleasant staff
632	5	We rented a cabin on site. Great open nature setting. Very Pet Friendly and clean!!! Was able to build a camp fire, and heard the river in the background. Roasted marshmallows. Walked 3 minutes to downtown bar. Great stay and MUST for any outdoors types with pets.
633	5	We brought my mom and dad for the first time to Helen, one of our favorite spots. Luckily we found the Riverbend Motel Cabins. The room was beautiful and the view even better. From the balcony you could watch the river rushing and see a variety of birds. The walk to Main Street was very short and pleasant. The... More
634	4	Nice place to stay, close to everything and you gotta meet Mark, he takes customer service to the next level. The room had a view of the river with a king bed that was really comfortable and the room was clean
635	3	Put into place a system that validates the total cleaning of each room. With special attention given to clean bed sheets and making certain that sheets are on mattress properly. The desk clerks were exceptional. The decor in the lobby was tasteful.
636	4	All of our requirements were met at the hotel, and my wife and I were very grateful to the friendly staff at the hotel. I wish that I knew the names of the staff members at the reception area with whom we had contact, so that I could commend them, individually... but, anyway, they were all obliging and helpful. The breakfast area staff and housekeeping staff (esp. Vilma) were great, as well. The hotel's location (in the center of Waikiki) was good, too. If I had to criticize anything at the hotel - (1) the egg preparations at breakfast could possibly be better and more varied (from day to day) and there could, maybe, be more breakfast meat options (instead of just the alternating bacon-and-sausage option) and (2) the shower/tub in our room was a bit dated (although it worked OK, and was never a real problem).Aloha Jerome S,Mahalo for staying at the Waikiki Gateway Hotel. I am glad that you enjoyed your renovated room and our fantastic location within a short walk of all that Waikiki has to offer as well as several convenient transportation options right at our doorstep. Our friendly staff is legendary for their Love Aloha and I am glad that you enjoyed their warm hospitality. We are currently renovating our bathrooms and I would be very excited to have you came back and see the finished product. I hope we see you again soon.Love Aloha,Kai
637	5	This boutique in the heart of Waikiki was excellent. The newly renovated rooms are clean, modern, and nicely furnished. A shout out to Will who made our stay at Gateway so special!! Will told us about some local restaurants and pointed out places nearby that we could visit. I am from SC and my friend is from Georgia. We really appreciated Will's Southern hospitality. Can't wait for a future visit to Waikiki and I'll be sure to book my stay at Gateway!Aloha kbsuarez,Thank you so much for staying with us and taking the time to share your experience. It warms my heart to hear you recognize Will. Our unbeatable staff strives to fill every guest's stay with Love Aloha team members like Will make this happen every day. We can't wait to see you again.Love Aloha,Kainua HopkinsGuest Experience Manager
638	5	Everyone was very helpful and extremely polite. Every housekeeper said Good morning, the front desk was exceptional at check in and check out, I have never met a nicer, friendlier group of people any where! The bistro was awesome! The rooms we stayed in was very, very clean but needed to be updated a little.
639	5	Like Best Western hotels and choose this hotel because it offered free parking and was on the St Charles street car line. Hotel is charming and the staff was so very friendly. Rooms were clean, spacious and breakfast was good. Beds were very comfortable. Loved that there were tables and chairs so we could sit outside. The garden district is so quiet compared to French Quarter. Loved the area and will be back to stay here again. Restaurant next door, Fresh Market and the Grocery right up the street. A few blocks to Magazine St. The staff could not have been friendlier. Loved talking with all of them. After staying in the French Quarter and here, this will be my first choice from now on. Can't wait to to go back.I'm happy to hear you had such a great stay! I love the area the hotel is located in. There is plenty to do and see, while still being much quieter than the French Quarter. Let us know when you are ready to come back! It is a great time of year to sit outside on our porch and watch the streetcars go by!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
640	3	The surrounding area does not appear safe. However, the actual street the hotel was on was pleasant and in the Garden district. Parking was gated, which was nice. It's also easy to catch a streetcar outside the hotel. It runs every 10 minutes. It was about a 25 minute street car ride. It took about 10 minutes to get to Canal and Burbon street area in our persona vehicle. The beds were comfortable, but were small (full size I believe). We were able fit 2 adults and 2 children in the room. The decor was nice and the lobby was average. We found clothes that were left behind in one of the drawers. The room was fairly clean. The whole hotel smelled like cleaning solution. We stayed one night and did not spend alot of time in our room. It was good for the price. There's also a simple restaurant and bar next door.Monica,Thank you for taking the time to write your review. Our rooms with two beds have two double beds in them. I'm glad you found them to be comfortable! It sounds like your family was able to do a lot in just one night in New Orleans. We are located in the Garden District, which is safe and quieter than other areas of the city. Luckily, the street car makes it easy to get to other parts of the city! It is great that our guests can take advantage of our free parking and use the streetcar. We hope you will come back and visit New Orleans and the St. Charles Inn.Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
641	5	My favorite hotel in NOLA due to great staff and location. The rooms are very good, beds comfortable. Wonderful walking area. Breakfast is only adequate offering, but it's free and better than most free breakfast offerings. Parking in rear is great.Davidbyerlapin, Thank you so much for the great feedback. We are so glad you enjoyed your stay and can't wait ot see you next time!
642	4	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for three days in June and it was a good choice. Very clean, friendly staff, enclosed and secure parking lot and very close of a walk to the St Charles st car line, Garden District and Magazine St. Also has a very good Mexican restaurant ( Superior Grill) next door. You can take the Streetcar and be in the French Quarter within a half of an hour. I plan on staying at this hotel again the next time we visit New Orleans
643	2	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights, arriving on Tuesday 7 October and departing Thursday 9th. I was very disappointed.My reservation for this stay was confirmed in January 2014. It was prepaid, and the charge was posted to my credit card account on 10 January last. I selected the hotel partly for its location, partly because it offered the facilities and amenities I sought, and partly because of good reviews on TripAdvisor.When we arrived at the hotel on 7 October, the lady on the front counter told me the MasterCard I presented was declined, and requested another card. Since I knew there was nothing wrong with my card or account, I stood my ground. Reluctantly she tried again, and succeeded. But that was clearly not her first choice.I told her the reservation was prepaid, which she denied. She said it would be charged to my card. After I got settled in my room I went online and downloaded a copy of my credit card statement for the month of January (showing the charge for this stay), which I showed the front desk lady. Reluctantly she agreed and asked pointedly It has not been charged to your account here, has itOne of the amenities that drove my choice of this hotel was free parking, as advertised on the hotels website. What it does not say is that there are only 40 or 41 spaces, given out on a first come first served basis. When we arrived they had all been given out. Because we were staying two nights I was permitted to park on the street in front of the hotel, rather than off-site (the other option). Neither of those options fits what I understand when a hotel advertises free parking. (I was given access to the hotel's parking area for our second night.)When we reached our room we were very disappointed at its size. There was neither room nor a stand to open two suitcases one case occupied the armchair, leaving only the desk chair for seating. This does not conform with what I expect from a Best Western, let alone a Best Western Plus hotel. And at 161 per night I consider it over-priced, though most hotels of this standard in New Orleans seem to charge around this figure.On both mornings we were at the hotel, when I stepped into the bath to shower there appeared black grime on the bath from my feet this came from the carpet. I complained the first morning and asked that the floor be vacuumed, but the problem was still there the second morning. I consider that the carpet in that room requires a shampoo.Finally, on both mornings when we came to breakfast the four tables provided were all fully used. On the first morning we had our breakfast in the Business Centre on the second morning we waited until other guests left.On the morning of our departure there appeared under the door a statement which, in the light of the initial denial that the reservation was prepaid, could have meant that the hotel had charged the stay to my credit card on the day of my arrival. The lady at the front desk on departure morning clarified that, though I must say bringing a January payment into the hotels account on 7 October seems a strange way to keep books. But the total of this statement exceeded my prepayment by 4.92, and appeared to say this amount was charged to my card on departure. I hope and expect that no attempt is made to recover this amount. A prepaid room is fully prepaid if the hotels charges change between when the stay is prepaid and when the guests arrive, that is the hotels risk. After all, they had my money for nine months. It is not a charge that can legitimately be passed on to the customer.Bruxin,I appreciate you taking time to let us know about the issues you had with the hotel. I am very sorry about the confusion with the prepayment. We just switched out front desk system, and they have been working on it for about a week and a half! The system is not playing well with out credit card swipers causing declines, so we have new ones on order. I have refunded the 4.92 to your credit card. The city implemented a tourism assessment in April causing the difference in your bill. I do heartily apologize for the disappointment in our hotelMelissa AlbertGeneral Managermalbertstcharlesinn.net
644	5	For a 3Star Hotel, we could not have been any happier with our selection! The hotel staff were super nice and efficient, especially Jeana at the front desk and Tatum in house keeping. The lobby is great with a very nice and plentiful breakfast, as well as snacks midday and coffee or lemon infused water all day! Our room was super clean and could not have been nicer, plus having two separate vanities/sinks really spoiled us. There was even a window in the bathroom for FRESH air. We found the French Quarters to be dirty and intimidating at times (so many homeless), so being in this area was another plus...surrounded by beautiful homes, trolley across the street, a few blocks from the Fresh Market grocery and the best bonus of all was the grassy park right next door which came in handy for those late night/early morning potty breaks for our dog. I am so glad that we were unable to find a pet friendly hotel WITH GRASS in the Quarters as we would have been so unhappy and absolutely loved our stay here, and this location for half the price also!! One more thing is parking...it was free and gated They gave us a remote control so we could come and go as we pleased knowing we would always have a free parking space waiting for us at the end of the day. Never saw a manager, but did not need to. Everything ran smooth and efficient. Good job!!
645	5	The staff was soooo friendly and helpful! It really does make all the difference. We loved the location in the Garden District surrounded by beautiful New Orleans style homes and away from all the noise of the French Quarter. The trolley was just out the front door so it was easy to get around.Breakfast was unusually good with a very nice assortment and they even had grab-and-go bags for guests in a hurry. Make-your-own waffles, eggs, sausage, oatmeal, cereals, juice, fruit, yogurt........The beds was really comfortable and there were lots of extra pillows. Nice bathroom toiletries including mouthwash in addition to the basics. We had a refrigerator and microwave plus coffee maker and supplies. There was even a ceiling fan!There was an outdoor terrace for breakfast if you preferred and next door was a very good Mexican restaurant with excellent margaritas! Free parking - which is a true luxury in NOLA.I was so pleased with my choice and I definitely recommend the hotel.Lili,Thank you for reviewing your stay. It sounds like y'all really enjoyed New Orleans and your stay with us! Our breakfast is one of my favorite things about the hotel. It has something for everyone! We will see you the next time you make it to New Orleans!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
646	4	The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was above average with fruit and yogurts. Staff were very friendly and helpful genuine interest in their guests, location is great with Tram stop very close direct to City Centre. Safe and gated parking area amazed me. Another thing about the location, St Charles Street is very wide with green space (for the trolley), trees, and historical homes in a nice neighborhood. I will definitely book this place again.We appreciate your review and business greatly! Hope to have you stay with us again.
647	5	We felt this hotel was perfect for taking the trolley to every location. Clean, Comfortable Bed, Air Conditioning worked great, breakfast was a hot Continental breakfast but you could grab juices and water out of the fridge in the lobby without charge and they always had fresh baked cookies. We were wanting to stay near the French Quarter but they were booked up and we were so glad we ended up staying in the Garden District. It was a nicer area and only took a short ride by trolley to get to the French Quarter and down to the Casino. We had secure parking. When we first checked in, we had a problem with our remote and the maintenance man came immediately and fixed the issue immediately. We had great recommendations from the front dest clerk. Just a very pleasant stay on a 2 month trip we were on.Maggie, thank you for taking the time to review your stay! I'm glad we were a fun spot on your two month trip! Even though we are not located in the French Quarter, we are so close that you can still easily get there and enjoy all it has to offer. Then after you explore there, you can come back and enjoy our quieter neighborhood! I hope you had a great road trip! We will see you the next time you visit New Orleans!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
648	4	Staff very pleasant and helpful, price was right, loved the front porch, right on the trolley line which took us to great househunting, great Mexican restaurant next door, convenient to everything we were doingThanks for your review.
649	5	This hotel was a great value and location for my wife and I in New Orleans. Located right off the trolley lines and midway between Tulane U. and downtown. The staff was extremely helpful with recommendations and our needs, especially Mollie and Janae. This location is also a quick walk to Magazine St. for great dining and bars. I'd recommend Rum House to anyone for dinner. The hotel was quiet, clean, offered an OK breakfast, had a workout room (but running on the trolley greenway is perfect) and business room. One of the best hotel values I've stayed at in a while.
650	3	stayed here for five nights.first impression good, front staff very helpful and friendly. Got to room,No View! all we saw were airconditioning units and the noise was annoying. Toilet wasnt clean, skid marks from previous person. This problem quickly rectified. Airconditioner in room very noisy. Shower head came flying off. horrible odour in bathroom after heavy rain. Breakfast was good. Great place to eat next door, but lots of choice around. short walk to Magazine st and Garden district.Thank you for taking time to review our hotel. I'm sorry you were not completely satisfied with your stay. I am glad you enjoyed your breakfast here, and you were able to explore and enjoy the great area we are located in. I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.Kathleen DavisFront Office Manager
651	4	Staying in NOLA during Jazzfest-I opt to not stay in the French Quarter-too congested and noisy then. This is a perfect location for me: easy to go to CBD and Quarter (by car or Streetcar) and free parking. And easy to go to the Uptown area restaurants and clubs. Staff is super, and genuinely nice.There is so much to do when Jazzfest is going on in New Orleans! It sounds like you had a great time while you were here for it. Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us. I'll pass along your compliments to the staff! Give us a call the next time you are ready to visit New Orleans!
652	5	We had a great experience at the St. Charles Inn. Our stay with BW Plus' are always great. The staff were very friendly, beds nice and comfy too. Secure parking and right on the trolley line so it could not have been more convenient for site-seeing. Breakfast was good, nice selection to choose from. We will definitely stay here on our next visit!I hope you were able to do a lot of site-seeing while staying with us! I'm glad you enjoyed our location, breakfast, and staff. Give us a call when you are ready to come back! Thank you for reviewing your stay!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
653	3	Was very convenient. Only complaint was slowness of check in and out due to a new computer system that staff was not familiar with. Although they were extremely nice it was very slow. My room mate and I wanted our bill split which they were not able to do.
654	4	Overall, a really good experience! The rooms were very clean and comfortable. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful we felt very welcomed. Also, the bus and train car were easily accessible and it was very easy to travel to Canal Street and the French Quarter.We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay. We hope to see you again for future Essence Fests! Melissa Albert General Manager malbertstcharlesinn.net
655	2	I did not like the fact that my card on file was previous charged before I checkin and I had the hardest time getting my funds credited back because one of the rooms reserved was done with cash upon arrival.Kristina,For all special events in New Orleans our reservations are full prepaid, so guests get charged before arrival. This was stated during your reservation process. We do this for events like Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, Essence Fest, and graduation weekends. I'm sorry if this caused any confusion, but it is our policy. Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
656	5	Stopped here after 11 hours of driving. Welcoming staff. Clean, well-appointed rooms. Good bedding for restful sleep. Rebooked before leaving for our return trip. Location was easy to find and there were a number of places for dinner nearby.
657	5	Absolutely excellent hotel to stay at! I was not at all comfortable sleeping in the waiting room at the hospital while my husband was in ICU but didn't want to be too far away from the hospital so I chose to stay at Hampton Inn and Suites. My reservation was made by a very courteous young man by the name... More
658	4	This Best Western in Raton is very clean, well maintained, and staffed by friendly and helpful people. There is also a restaurant on the premises that includes a small bar and TV's. A free buffet breakfast is included, complete with dishes, silverware, and a hostess. Very nice stay in a somewhat remote area.
659	1	Nice place to stay. It is at walking distance to SDSU, about 20 minutes, where you can take the trolley to downtown San Diego.The personal is very kind. The rooms are big and the place is quiet. Nearby you can find restaurants and shops.
660	5	This hotel is amazing. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. They go out of their way to help with anything. The room was beautiful and roomy. Love the balcony. The pool and hot tub was clean and bright. The atmosphere was great. Our home away from home in London.
661	5	We chose this hotel based on its TripAdvisor reviews and we were not disappointed. We stayed here for five nights with our two young children and visited the zoo, Balboa Park, Sea World and Coronado during our stay. The hotel was near the zoo/Balboa Park and was a reasonable distance from Sea World and the beach. El Cajon Blvd has many ethnic (Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, Kosher) restaurants and the usual fast food chains. We did not see any restaurant chains such as Outback, Denny's, or Chili's near the hotel. There are several grocery and drug stores nearby. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood with our kids.Our room was clean with updated bedding and furniture and had a fridge and microwave. It was not large, but adequate for our needs. We did not have any problems with noisy neighbors or noise from the street during late-night hours. The free continental breakfast was good. The only thing I found missing was yogurt. We asked for advice and directions from the front desk several times and they never led us astray. We also purchased discount zoo tickets from the front desk. We used the pool once and it was fine.I agree with another reviewer that it is just a motel. However, we spent less than 100/night here and we were happy with our choice.
662	4	Very homey, clean place which even had a frig for our stuff. There suprisingly was a workout room and a public computer along with a vending machine down by the office. No pool or sauna. We had a 3 bed room and there was plenty of space for 4 of us and our stuff. Plenty of parking even for boats.... More
663	5	Very comfortable with great service and convenient location. Rooms were a bit smaller than other Homewood Suites at which we have stayed, but it was clean, comfortable, and quiet. We enjoyed our stay and will stay again!
664	1	Idk what was worse rude lady at the front desk or the smell coming from the carpet. It turned my feet black! How gross is that!

665	5	We only stayed one night, but we will definitely stay here again. We had a one bedroom suite and it was so spacious and comfortable. There was even an extra half bath in the living room area! The full bath was very large and beautiful. The only issue we had was that dirty sheets were left on the pull out... More

667	4	All the usual chains in Wenatchee were uninteresting and overpriced so I drove west into Cashmere. The Village Inn is family run simple but spotless. More character, in a tidy gem of a town, and less expensive.
668	5	Ninety- nine percent of the times we have stayed with Hampton, our expectations have been met. The beds are clean and comfortable. The rooms never have the funky odors other hotels sometimes have. Staff is always well trained and efficient.
669	2	This place is a dump! It rides off the coat tails of being haunted, but I guess the only ghost here is the maintenance person. The place has everything antique, but that's no excuse for having crappy accommodations. The bathroom towel rack is secured with a piece of wire. Also, despite the king size bed headboard being beautiful, you can... More

712	5	Lovely place with its own style .... Appreciate that it is not trying to copy the general boutique hotel style that is available everywhere these days. Feels like it belongs in San Antonio. Not trying to be LA our Miami etc etc
713	5	The Hotel Emma is gorgeous! There is something to do in every corner. The ENTIRE STAFF from the waiters, to the concierge, the front desk, housekeeping, everyone was friendly, kind attentive. I would HIGHLY recommend The Hotel Emma for your next San Antonio stay.
714	5	My husband enjoyed a lovely, romantic one-night stay at Hotel Emma recently for our anniversary. Everything was perfect! Our room was clean and beautiful. The bathroom was luxurious, down to the robes, slippers, and bath products. And the service was top notch. We can't wait...More

716	5	The hotel itself is nestled in such a gorgeous area, and we loved that the (super cool) mural on the entrance to the hotel was done by local artists. The room was beautiful, and we received the most adorable little succulent as a welcoming gift. We were in walking distance of some awesome restaurants, and we were given a coupon... More

It was clean and the room attractive they may still be in the throes of remodeling the royal blue curtains, beautiful and kept the room dark for a good rest and the sun out from extreme heat. Pillows, bed and bedding were great and dcor attractive fitting the curtains and spread. AC worked but we... More
720	5	The Husker Inn is a great old-style motel, with modern amenities and updated. Small, very reasonably priced, and the staff is excellent. It's right on the eastern edge of downtown, so restaurants and coffee shops are very close by. Try it.
721	4	The hotel staff provided great service, the room was very nice with a fridge and microwave, and the Wi-Fi was great. Also, I liked the really nice breakfast. The hotel is just off of the Waterson Pkwy. Good experience.
722	1	The rooms are poorly insulated from the outside noise. There is a bar of some sorts next door that played loud music both nights during our two night stay. It was so loud I could hear and understand individual words from the songs - through the walls of both the motel and the bar. It's not just that though, you... More
723	4	This hotel met the bill for everything we needed to do for our visit. It's right on the edge of the GT campus and directly across from the campus bookstore (lots of swag available) it's within walking distance of a MARTA stop, and the busy downtown Peachtree/Centennial area is about a mile away, which translates into a quick taxi ride or one subway stop away. The area felt safe, and the hotel was clean and the staff pleasant. It's not a luxury hotel, but the price is among the best in the area.Thank you for the nice review. Our location lends itself to a variety of attractions, local restaurants, sporting venues and of course our location on the GT campus is unmatched in the market. We are delighted you enjoyed your visit with us and will share your comments with all of our team members.
724	5	Very customer-focused! All of the staff takes a customer first approach. Great facilities for conferences.
725	5	We stayed three nights during an unusual frigid period with a big snowfall as well. The suite was much appreciated.

She offered to lend us a... More

Very clean,... More

729	5	This neat little boutique hotel features a handful of cozy and quiet rooms above the hustle and bustle of Whiskey Row. The staff was kind and accommodating, putting out local pastries and cookies in the afternoon. We stayed in the Mount Vernon room, which was quaint and decorated beautifully - really adding to the old west vibe of Whiskey Row.... More
730	3	I found this on Trip advisor to be the top rated hotel in Phoenix. Hmm, maybe need to rethink my sources It was fine. But really - another 'cool industrial hotel' with large common areas to hang with other hotel guests. Yikes. We had a large room with a balcony. Sliding walls were good but the weird blue velvet curtain that separated the bathroom from the bedroom was weird. There were 5 sinks in our room. One in the toilet room, two that overlooked the living room and two that overlooked the bedroom. Why Then there was a 'super cool' shower with clear glass that said SEXY and another shower that was frosted that said NOT SEXY. What No tub. No closet. A corner with a place to hang some clothes next to the sexy shower....and a smaller blue velvet curtain. NO! Maybe I am just too old for this place Give me a nice bathroom with a great shower, double sink and a deep tub..a coffee pot and a great bed and I am happy. Hey! Thanks for the feedback. There aren't actually any other industrial hotels in Phoenix, which, is why we pride ourselves on our look and feel. We understand that we're not for everyone, but we appreciate you giving us a try!
731	5	I spent 2 nights in this Unique property - If you love Art and you love the unusual and sensory pleasures of sight and taste this is the place for you.Upon my arrival I was greeted with enthusiasm and an eagerness to please. Every associate from the Valet, Front Desk, Bartender, Restaurant staff could not have been better. Since I travel often and am in 5 star properties - I was delighted at the wonderful service of this property. Open spacious rooms with a very sexy element - great city views - comfortable beds. Very eclectic - modern - artistic - beautiful.The bar had a variety of custom beverage none of which were your ordinary spirits. Match (the restaurant) offered a fantastic menu with delicious dishes many with a twist.Whoa! This review just blew us away. There are those guests who just get it and you totally nailed our vision in this review. Thank you for the kind words and for sharing your experience. We'll be sure to share with the team! We do hope you'll come back soon.
732	5	What a great and unexpected hotel find this was. Found:re had the best combination of a downtown location with cool and interesting decor throughout both the common spaces and guest room. I was there for a quick business trip and the entire staff from valet to front desk to restaurant/bar staff were super friendly and efficient while making sure everything about my stay was excellent. Food in the restaurant was top notch for both dinner and breakfast. The pool was small by Phoenix standards, but perfect for a quick cooling dip after a scorching hot day. Highly recommended place to stay in Phoenix if you are tired of the same old formula chain hotels. Thank you so much. We're happy to hear you had a great stay. Please visit again soon!
733	3	Great check in staff. The price was right for the quality of the room we had. The room has seen a lot of visitors Cracked tub, dirty rug, filthy mirror over sink. Definitely needs to be overhauled. Stayed one night only and moved on.
734	1	1-now it is two months that they are constructing while they are renting their rooms to customers. you are tired and you are sleep while the workers are working with big saws and non-stop hammer sound just near your room. they must close the hotel while they are under construction. but the greedy owner installed a plastic in front of workers area and rent other rooms to poor customer with nonrefundable policy!!! you are sleeping in a construction site. the sound of construction make others crazy and have to leave hotel in rain or while you are sleepy and must walk in street until worker stop working. the greedy owner who is afraid of revenge of some angry customer and destroying of some facility of hotel because of this tricks of owner,impel all of customer to give her a deposit or credit card charge for probably damages to room!!! she charge you when you reserved your room with a nonrefundable policy because she is sure you will demand for refund because her hotel isn't live-able.she only think to money of customer and after charge of your card no service and non-refund and a lot of problem. 2-internet connection is always disconnected. 3-every floor only two bathrooms,you must wait for a vacant bathroom. 4-even you must negotiate a lot for a simple tissue. 5-no elevator,3 floor. 6-no telephone in rooms,with no elevator you must to come down by stairs for every simple inquiry. 7-wooden and thin walls,a lot of sound of sex and argue of others is in your head. the owner is oppressing others by renting this rooms.8-no air condition9-scream of complaint of others make you angry.10-so dirty rooms.11-reception has no authority to solve problem of customer,for every thing they must call owner and describe whole of story while you are waiting.in most case you only hear that(this is policy of owner).12-outside of hotels there are a lot of vagrant gays,we always start to run and went inside of hotel rapidly,very bad location.wow I became crazy in San Francisco because of this hotel.I cant believe in USA something like this.oh no.
735	5	Everything was wonderful the room large bright, location, and price. Easy walk to Fisherman's Wharf end of Cable Car line friendly, helpful staff. Only negative was they wanted 5.00 to print out 2 boarding passes 2.00 would be OK 5.00 is exorbitant.
736	4	Great value for a great location! Rooms are big and spacious, bathroom is a great size. All rooms come with free wifi which is fantastic, and there is free parking (which we didn't need). If you don't have a car you can catch a bus right at the front or you can walk the short walk to Fisherman's Wharf. Additionally if you want to ride a bike around the city there is a place next door that rents them. The staff are quite friendly and helpful for when asking questions about the city.If we do go back to San Francisco in the future we will return! Thanks for the great stay!!
737	4	Having stayed at the sister property the Coventry Motor Inn back in 2014 and enjoying it, we chose this place when looking for affordable accommodations (with parking) in a slightly different area. This time around, we were spending 2 nights in SF at the end of a 3 week roadtrip decided to do one hotel more budget (this one) and then the final night being a bit more of a splurge at another hotel on the Embarcadero.The hotel is easy to find, and we got lucky with a parking space right near to the lobby to check in. The chap was nice and we'd booked a room on the top floor to try and make the best of the limited views this location has - we were a little early but he called through there and then to the housekeeper who was working on our room, and she said it'd be about half an hour, so we had a wander and had a beer and a game of pool in the bar across the street, and were able to check in on returning.The rooms were very similar to the Coventry Inn, in that they are older style, but clean, spacious and comfortable. One added bonus with the Columbus Inn was the small balcony we had in our room - enough to step out on and watch the world go by and with surprising good views of Coit Tower and even a glimpse of the Golden Gate across the rooftops, so I was a happy bunny!We were getting to the end of our stamina on this 4000 odd mile trip, and so opted to order take out to be delivered to the hotel for dinner. It was easy, and after signing up to Grubhub online (with the WiFi being included in the room price) and selecting a place, we called down to let reception know we had a delivery coming and he said they would bring it right up to the room for us - something we're not used to in UK hotels, but very convenient for 2 weary travellers!We were able to eat properly too, as the room has a small dining table and chairs next to the window. Winner! The bathroom is only small, but has a separate vanity/sink area so it was still functional. We slept great in the large comfy bed, and grabbed a yummy breakfast next morning at a cafe in the next street in walking distance, so that was another plus. All in all, i'd recommend this hotel and definitely stay there again. Nice work Columbus!!! :-)
738	4	Great value for money. Perfectly positioned for Fisherman's Wharf, Little Italy, China Town, and the cable cars, as well as many other attractions. Rooms were nothing special but clean and comfortable. The staff on the front desk were friendly and extremely helpful.A great place to stay in a great city at a very reasonable price!
739	3	We have found this place thanks to Tripadvisor - it didn't pop out on Booking or anywhere else. We used their own website to book the room. What I was looking for was a place near Fisherman Wharf with easily accessible parking. This place went one step ahead and offered free parking and a room with reasonable price.The location is excellent - within walking distance from the wharf, at rather quiet (for S.F. standards) street . If the location is what you care about - I can definitely recommend this hotel. What surprised me (in a good way) was the free WiFi connection which was very fast and reliable, which is not always a case in American hotels. A coffee maker was a nice addition to the room and super cold drinks from the hotel vending machine saved our lives on a very tough morning )OK, now the dark side of the hotel... First of all, it wasn't the place you want to spend a romantic weekend at - it was not perfecly clean, there was this strange smell in the hallway and in the room which gives you a message it's high time to change carpets and mattresses all over the place. But you can get used to it after a day or two )I've mentioned the parking - yes, it was free (yay!) and easy to find. And yes, you could always take your car out without waiting for the valet. But the whole area and parking places themselves were very small and it took me some time to park the car and then get out of it. If you're driving a rental and you don't know and 'feel' the car - it can get a little bit tricky. Last thing was the front desk service... I know it's not the Ritz but - come on, guys! - calling a cab for your guests shouldn't be a problem, right Well, it is at Columbus.
740	4	The room was big and the queen beds were comfortable. There was a good view on Columbus Street. The furniture is not luxurious, but feels solid. The bathroom was a bit tiny but clean. The location is almost excellent: you just have to walk five minutes to go to the heart of North Beach, the italian quarter, full of restaurants and one of the best location to sleep in San Francisco. You can find the best Espresso there.. and a lot of great places for breakfast! (there is no breakfast in the motel). The elevator could a little crowded at morning, if you are in hurry, take the stairs! A nice motel in a great district!
741	5	For some reason there were bad reviews for this place on Trip advisor however we found this place awesome! The room was clean unique and comfortable. Wifi is fast and the attendants were super nice. It was well priced and we really enjoyed our stay.
742	1	non english speaking staff, paint peeling from walls, no internet available, breakfast was cold cereal and old milk on a counter top, dirty carpet, very old furnishings, not a good area of town, no deadbolt or chain on door, bathroom window did not shut, spray paint peeling off bathtub. not worth more than about 10.00 per night. they have hourly rates too..go figure the illegal business must be keeping them in business.NO not a good value at all.
743	2	We stayed at La Hacienda because it was close to the SafeCo field and we had to get to a Mariner's game. We decided it was only for one night and we would leave immediately int the morning. The service was bad, with non-english speaking staff. The shower and sink did not drain and when we complained to the employees they did nothing to fix it. The carpet was dirty, there were spots on the wall where the wallpaper was ripping off and they had tried to patch it. The TV didn't work and there were creepy people hanging around the parking lot. The next day we discovered there were bedbugs in the beds, as one member of our group had gotten bitten in quite a few places. It was certainly not worth the money.
744	2	This place was just ok, sketchy looking clientele lingering around outside, immediately next to the highway so ask for a room on the not highway side of the building. Spent the night just fine with only slight noise from neighbors but found an adult bed bug crawling on the wall in the bathroom (see photos) that went behind the light... More
745	5	Check-in stay was very welcoming. Helped me locate restaurants, stores, places to visit. My room had a lot of space with a couch. Bathroom was nothing special, but clean and well kept. Breakfast was standard fare, but great service from the staff. View from my room overlooked a storage rental business, but you could see the mountains in the distance.... More
746	4	We stayed in late June 2015 and had a great experience. Our room was clean, wifi service was fast and dependable, and breakfast was fine. The business center is one computer off the breakfast area, and was easy to access and use. Good night sleep, which we needed after a long day exploring the coast, Crescent Lake, and parkland.
747	5	Bed was soooooo comfortable. Bathroom was nice. Fast food very close, real food just a few blocks away. Very good value. There are nicer hotels but at twice the price. I highly recommend this hotel to anybody who wants a good nights sleep at a reasonable cost. Close to Kenai airport
748	4	I was looking for the place to spend a night or two near Searcy Arkansas . My family were taking part in events taking place at Harding. I made the booking with Regency Inn.

750	4	Clean comfortable room right off interstate 70. The best thing about it was its access to a fantastic bar and grill called Oscar's bar and grill. The restaurant is literally right across the parking lot from the hote.

752	5	On the way to Wichita, Kansas stayed at this motel for a night. Talk about surprised and pleased with staff, rooms, service, breakfast and cleanliness. There is also a good Mexican restaurant nearby, but the owners just made me feel like I was at home though Los Angeles was a ways off.
753	5	When I travel for business I typical stay in the big chain hotels but this hotel has changed my mind. There is something very special about having breakfast and talking to the owner of the hotel at the same time. Hotel is new, modern, and very clean with everything you could want with a stay when traveling. Get little place... More
754	5	Every experience at this hotel was excellent. Great location, nice venue, great employees at every level, friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend if in the area. Transportation to airport and nearby venues a big plus.
755	4	The staff is polite and professional at all times. I love the fact that checkout is at noon. The free breakfast was delicious! The bed in the room was comfortable. There is a outdoor pool and a nice fitness center.
756	1	Was in town for a basketball tournament, and stayed here. Big mistake. The rooms smelled like rotten food or something. There were wires sticking out of the heater as if somebody was working on it. The rooms were very dated and the beds were not comfortable. Would be better off at a motel 6 for the money. On my second... More
757	3	The shared areas like the kitchen and the bathrooms were pretty modern and nice. Breakfast included was basic but it's free. Our bed was really comfy and although it was quite loud outside we slept quite well. The bedrooms and hallways could do with a bit of TLC but in general it was clean and pleasant. The area around the hotel isn't great... there a lot of homeless people around but we didn't feel unsafe at any time and would stay here again.
758	3	Minna Hotel provides breakfast in the morning and professional staff to accomodate guests. They accept payment throught cards and cash. Cozy rooms with central heating system in place with hot / cold water 24 hours
759	2	You can hardly call this a hotel. The neighbourhood is dirty! A lot of homeless people on the streets who make a lot of noise during the night! The rooms are very small, there was no service at all. The showers an dtoilet on the floor, so in the morning you have to wait a while to refresh. During my tour in western States thius was the worst experience! The price FAR to high for what you get!Distance to the town is OK. The only positiv thing on this place if you feel good to walk between the homeless. Bottles, dirt etc...
760	3	Rooms are clean but you must share a bathroom. Only a few blocks from Moscone Center and some good restaurants. Continentel breakfast is only muffins and toast with coffee and juice but at least its enough to start your day. Value is good for the prices.
761	5	My stay was.very.pleasant from checkin to.checkout. This was Milwaukee's busiest weekend. Several.of the housekeeping staff really went.the extra mile. Room was spotless and nice, breakfast was good. Will definitely stay again.
762	5	After a late afternoon ferry ride from CT, we scrambled to find a place to stay nearby and drove the extra miles to get to this place. And what a location it was. Nested in trees just a stone throw from the ocean. Room was very clean with comfy double beds and large TV. Bath was also spotless and of... More
763	4	JoAnne's cheese steaks are awesome. I also like the hot turkey sandwiches. There is a wide variety of items to choose from on the menu. Prices are reasonable and service is good. May take a bit longer if there is a large crowd.
764	5	We have been staying in Econo Lodge's, and they have just been slacking lately! We tried Quality Inn and was so happy that we did!! Very clean, great breakfast, free WiFi. The staff was very nice! We got a wonderful nights sleep.
765	4	I had to attend a meeting here and decided to stay the night. The room was clean and the staff was pleasant. Nice pool andJacuzzi. Coffee shop also served Starbucks coffee but had their own sandwiches which were really good and worth the price. Most of the other guests there also had breakfast there rather than in the nearby mall and were happy with their orders as well. The mall is also quite near, walking distance with a wide selection of food.
766	2	There were no restaurants in the hotel open on Saturday night. I had to go to the Gift Shop to eat chips, candy, for supper. I had no car. You should have a shuttle service to Love Field for pickup. I had to beg for a ride to take me back to Love Field on Sunday morning. I do not recommend this hotel at all.
767	5	Cool modern and tasteful, this calm gem at the south end of the strip will be my go-to in Las Vegas. All accommodations are true suites with a separate living room (not large in my moderate price selection) one full extraordinary bathroom and a powder room. A great set up if traveling with someone who needs to get some work... More
768	4	We had a very good trip. The hotel was excellent, the food was great. Gambling was not too good but it was the experience that counts. I would certainly consider this hotel for my next trip. It is one of my favorites.
769	4	I stayed at the Wynn for one day right before staying at the Delano for 4 days. I found it to be a contrast of luxury hotels. The Wynn is most likely the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in all the luxury hotels in Vegas and most in the world. The Delano was substantially... More

771	5	We stayed at the River 1 cabin which had 3 bedrooms, nice appliances, and two bathrooms. Being on the river worked out very well for the grandsons and the facilities made the stay very pleasant for 3 generations. Owners very helpful. Overall was clean but noted quite a bit of dust under the beds. Bathroom fans pretty loud and wired... More
772	2	We recently rented the Boeves cabin at the Flying Arrow resort. The cabin is in a great location and has a deck overlooking the river which is very nice. With that being said, I would not rent it again. The upstairs which has 2 bedrooms is hard to get to having to having to make your way up stairs that... More
773	4	We stayed here 9/14/15 for two nights while visiting Crater Lake. Our room was clean and very nice. It's not the Hilton but we would stay here again. It was quiet and reasonably priced. We locked the keys in the trunk and the office lady was very nice to help us.
774	1	I don't even know where to begin with. I am totally disgusted with the entire experience. My nightmare began as soon as I reach the hotel and find out that my room (which was requested over the phone and confirmed by the front desk staff) was not available. I was given only 2 options, so had to settle for one. The property is filthy, dirty, stains everywhere from carpet, sofa, chairs to curtains and even on ceiling. Bed was very uncomfortable, loud noises from above, corridors, parking lots, creaking floors, slamming doors. Hair in bathroom, extremely loud a/c. The list will just go on and on.The icing on the cake comes the next day morning at checkout, I am asked to pay extra for my room. Rude staff, no sense of customer service whatsoever. I told her that I had booked the stay via priceline.com and pre-paid for my stay. She wanted to look at paperwork, expressly stating that I can't take your word for it, I have to see the paperwork. Insisted that she had all records, but surprisingly couldn't find mine. I refused to pay any extra money and she had to call and change the rate codes. Whatever !!Please save yourself and DO NOT ever stay at this place. I am disgusted beyond words.I appreciate you taking the time to write a review of your experience with us. The cleanliness of the hotel and the interaction with the front desk you described is unacceptable, and I sincerely apologize for your experience. To make sure this doesn't happen again, I am meeting with the entire staff to review your comments and discuss how we can avoid a similar situation in the future. We continually work to improve our hotel, so I really appreciate you providing us with your feedback. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly, at dmcextendedstay.com, should you wish to discuss this further. We would love to have another chance to provide you with a better experience at our hotel the next time you're in town.
775	1	This is the most unprofessional extended stay property. It is very old and outdated. The associates are not well trained, and there never seems to be a manager on duty available. The check in process takes forever, the front desk staff was not trained properly on online reservation codes. The rooms smelled terrible. Do not fall in the lowest rate possible trap. Even with a low rate, you don't get what you pay for. AVOIDI received a copy of your review, and wanted to take a moment to personally respond. Please accept our most sincere apologies for all the problems you encountered during your stay. Your comments were reviewed by the staff, and we will holding daily team meetings to make sure your experience is not repeated. We continually work to improve our hotel, so I really appreciate you providing us with your feedback. If you have any additional feedback, please reach out to me at dmcextendedstay.com. We do hope you will choose to stay with us again so we can have the opportunity to provide you with a better experience.
776	1	From the time we pulled into the parking lot, then we went in and the smell was horrible. went to the room, the hallways smelled of smoke. and the room was ok. no wash cloths and no sheets or blankets for the pull out bed..The stay was no pleasant at all.Please accept our sincere apologies for the problems you encountered. You deserved a comfortable and stress-free stay, and we did not live up to your expectations.

788	3	I have always stayed in a other hotel when visiting Dallas, but they didn't have availability this time for two days. i ended up staying here for half my visit and then moving to my regular hotel. After two days of living here, I could have stayed on. I loved the location, there is a Starbucks and CVS at a walkable distance - just across from the hotel. The rooms are clean, and big sized. It's structured like a suite, so you get some living room space too. The kitchen is well equipped. It's well connected, they have a complimentary wi if service and the internet speed is good. The only downside being that the area is not considered very safe, but I didn't encounter any issues.The breakfast is very average, No in-house restaurant. I don't like their wash rooms, very small and the products are very very average - I would recommend to carry your own shampoo, body wash etc along. The staff is friendly and helpful.Thank you for your review and I am glad you enjoyed our spacious rooms. I did want to let you know that we do offer full service in house dining in our restaurant, lounge and room service. Thank you again and I hope you will stay with us the next time you are in Dallas.
789	5	I stayed at the Hawthorn for 5 months. The people were great, the rooms are clean. I will stay there any time. Dear anjilitac,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you as our guest, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest! Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central
790	5	My husband and I stayed 5 nights and were extremely pleased with all aspects of our stay. I had been a little apprehensive prior to arrival because the price was so good, I feared that the room might not be as nice as we wanted. However, we were thrilled with the appearance, cleanliness, service, and friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. We would definitely choose this hotel again.Thank you for your kind review and I am glad to hear how much you enjoyed your stay. The Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central is perfect for long stays and I hope you will visit us again the next time you are in Dallas.
791	3	This is one of the hotels our company uses for our Dallas airport stays, so we stay here about four times a month. I have mixed feelings. In general, I like the rooms a lot. They are clean and have fairly modern finishes. They have a good sized kitchenette with a large refrigerators, however, many of them are broken. Instead of fixing them, they have placed a lot of small fridges in the room as well, but not all, so if you need a fridge check to see if it works after checking into your room. Also, a lot of the rooms have Air conditioners that don't work properly, this is a big problem in Dallas in the summertime. On my last stay, two nights ago, I had one of theses rooms with a faulty A/C unit and broken fridge. The A/C seemed to work in the first hour, so I unpacked all my things and it was late in the evening, about 11pm. By the time I noticed it started to get very hot in the room it was too late to pack up all my things ( I had an extremely long work day and was exhausted ). I called the front desk and no one answered the first call even though I let it ring for awhile. I tried back and a very surly man answered like he was very bothered and annoyed. I told him the A/C wasn't working and also the fridge was broken. Silence. I could almost here the 'So, what do you want me to do about it' in his thoughts! After an awkward silence, he said to hold on. He then sent someone up to change my room which I declined because of the time and effort. That same night checking in, there was a different clerk who seemed um, medicated let's say, she was very harried and distracted and had trouble checking a two of us in, she couldn't seem to get her thoughts straight, it was pretty strange. I would hope they could get their staff to act in a more professional manner. I have to say their shuttle drivers are awesome, very prompt and friendly. Maybe they should put the shuttle drivers behind the front desk and make the front desk clerks the shuttle drivers Just an idea.
792	5	Just needed a night away for myself and so here is where I stayed. The room was very nice and the hotel was very quite. Met a friend for dessert and it was pretty tasty.

794	4	This resort is in a state of flux, though the excellent staff does make it easier to endure the noise and inconvenience of construction. The furnishings in our 2 bedroom unit were old and the unit, overall, was exhibiting signs of wear. The main pool is large and fun, though there is NO cafe or food service. None! Other resorts...

795	5	I was down for the 43rd Bayou Classics and it was a great first time stay the Aloft Hotel. The staff and service was great and on point. I was amazed at the entrance, I played a little pool lol with my wife!!!! Great stay and I will definitely stay here next year. Wonderful! Thanks for making us your hotel of choice when you come back.
796	4	this is a converted hotel from some prior something...rooms a bit small but you aren't there but to sleep when in the Big Easy....nice yet not luxurious which is why i say middle of the road. Great staff. We go a few times of year - will be on the list of options to be sure - block of canal at Baronne...big plusWe'll take it! See you again next visit,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations
797	4	A friend recommended the Aloft, after we had chosen another hotel. We made the switch and were pleased with our experience. We travel often to Europe and felt the European character. My wife and I do not need a lot of amenities-but their exercise room and bar were enough. Since the 'Big Easy' has plenty of excellent restaurants and this hotel was within a very few blocks of the heart of the French Quarter, we did not expect a full restaurant. I would mention that next time I would want to be told that my room did not have windows!!Simple, comfortable and all you need. We do have some great views for your next visit, be sure to book the Aloft rooms so we are able to find the best one for you.Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations
798	5	We've never stayed at Aloft hotels before, but This is a Great hotel with very friendly staff in a great location! We will definitely stay here again when we come back to visit New Orleans. I would definitely recommend this hotel.That's fantastic! We look forward to your next visit. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations

It was a very quiet... More

Location excellent witha Wendys,Ruby Tuesday, waffle House, and Cracker Barrel all a few steps away. Stayed at Super 8 in the past,but not any more. Staff very friendly, and nice area to walk a dog.
816	4	Good for a night's stop over at Barstow. We had a pretty good sleep after a long tiring day. The queen beds and pillows were very comfortable. Room was pretty much clean. Overall its a good property at a cheap price. Though they did not have free breakfast.
817	4	Stayed here for college visits to Anderson university and Furman. Room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was as expected from comfort suites. It was easy off interstate and from downtown Anderson. Room rate with AAA was very good on Sunday night, 77 plus taxes totaled 84. We will stay here again if the need arises.
818	4	The room was clean and bed was comfortable. Some what expensive but less than almost all others in the area. Breakfast was Danish or bagel and coffee was good. Great customer service and if I make it back to Gettysburg, I would stay there again.
819	5	The quality of the staff is unparralled, better than any 5 star hotel I've visited. If you are looking for an impersonal chain hotel, this isn't it. Unique and quirky in a good way. Space is a premium, the rooms and bath are on the small side,....but not exceedingly so. Great room amenities, refrigerator, safe, plenty of power outlets and usb ports for charging electronics and even a mini bar with great snacks. And roof top deck for hanging out which was little used by the guest when I was there, so I had it all to myself. There's even a great cafe attached to the hotel with excellent food. But the real star was the staff. Always friendly, interested in the quality of your stay and very helpful at all hours of the day and night.Reading your review has brought me so much joy, thank you for sharing your experience with the rest of the world. I hope it entices others to enjoy our humble establishment as you have.William J Strickland Hotel Manager
820	5	First time visiting Hawaii and booked the Shoreline Hotel, I can't fault it at all position is awesome 2-7 min walk to everything you need from restaurants, shops, bars, beach etc... Stayed on the fourth floor, rooms are very clean and bed was so comfortable. Grab and go breakfast is great with muffins, bars, coffee, tea to go. Small issue with tv which was fixed in less than five minutes.Excellent staff always willing to help, with directions things to see made my first trip to Hawaii very easy and enjoyable. Big shout out to Yianni, who was very helpful with his knowledge around the island.Already planning my next trip and booking The Shoreline again.. Keep up the good work guys!!!Aloha!Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience with us on TripAdvisor! We're thrilled you enjoyed your stay with us and I'm sure Yianni is tickled knowing he made a difference in your stay. When you're booking your next Hawaiian getaway, we hope you'll choose to stay with us again!Mahalo
821	4	If you are not looking for a resort hotel, but looking for a hotel in a great central location, with nice, clean rooms and efficient service, look no further than the Shoreline. We had seven nights here in May 2014 and really enjoyed staying there. It is a cute little hotel, modernized and very comfortable. The bed and pillows were great and I am very fussy! We had a view of the disgusting building next door, and a tiny peep of the sea! Honestly, given the quality of the hotel, the cost, and the little time we spent in our room, it was not a big deal. Why would you pay for a resort hotel and view when it appears you can use the facilities of the pools on the beach anyway during the day. If we ever return to Waikiki, we will be staying at the Shoreline again.Aloha Megan FThank you for your 4 star review. We are thrilled knowing we exceeded your expectations and were able to provide a memorable stay. While it is true we are not a bigger resort our hotel more than makes up for it with our centralized location, complimentary amenities, and competitive room rates. Not to mention our hotel does not charge any resort fees that bigger hotels charge. While it is unfortunate that the view from your room was not to your liking our city view accommodations face the surrounding areas of where this building is placed. For your next trip please consider booking one of our partial ocean view rooms. Thank you once again for your kind words we hope to be able to accommodate you once again.Mahalo,Daniel Floren,Front Office Manager
822	4	This hotel was nothing fancy but it was clean and newly renovated. The decor was really funky and tasteful. The room was quite small but we didn't spend much time in it anyway. Bonus: the bed was really comfortable and we got free beach towels everyday. The restaurant next door was really tasty and had nice staff.Aloha Jaime S!Mahalo for taking the time to post such a nice review! Sometimes it's the simple joys of life that set a hotel apart from all the others and that's exactly what we are trying to accomplish here at the Shoreline Hotel Waikiki, a Joie de Vivre hotel. I am so glad that you enjoyed the decor and found the bed to be really comfortable! I hope the next time you visit Waikiki, you will come back to stay with us.Mahalo!Brian AkerDirector of Rooms
823	5	My husband and I just returned home after staying here for 7 nights. We stayed in a king size room which was nice and spacious, clean and the bed was very comfortable. We also had a small fridge and microwave. We stayed on the 6th floor which was pretty quiet. The reception staff are very warm and welcoming, and there is free tea/coffee/chilled water/pineapple iced tea in the lobby 24/7. The housekeeping staff are also very friendly, always saying 'Aloha' when you cross their paths. The location is FANTASTIC, with the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Centre at the end of the street and restaurants/cafes all within a few minutes walking distance. The new cafe that has opened up next door called 'Heavenly Cafe' is a good spot for breakfast. Try the pulled pork with eggs.......TO DIE FOR!!! Thanks to all the staff at The Shoreline for a wonderful stay.......made my birthday very memorable.Aloha statsmarty, Thank you for choosing our hotel to celebrate your birthday. We are glad to see that our great location and friendly service was able to make a memorable experience. Each of our staff members excel in showing our guests the Aloha Spirit unknown to those not from Hawaii. Please share your experience with your friends and family and tell them of the great things the Shoreline Hotel Waikiki has to offer. We hope to see you again happy holidays.Mahalo,Jerome YapchingAssistant Front Office Manager
824	3	Plenty has been written about the location, so I'll just confirm, it's centrally located in Waikiki (close to shopping and restaurants) but not to the beach. Our flight arrived very late evening and we had booked a King with a City View. We were checked into a very dark room on the 2nd floor with no balcony. Given that we were staying 4 days here, we really wanted to change rooms and called the front desk but were told there was no other room available, although we asked if we could move in the morning, we were given a very non-committal answer. Given we had just had a very long flight, we just decided to accept our fate but were not happy. The next morning, we were up early and spoke to Mona at the front desk. She was AMAZING! Unlike the service we received the night prior, she immediately started looking for an alternate room for us. She asked us regarding our plans for the day, and did her utmost to offer us an alternate room before we began our day's activities. She provided us with a few options and we were moved about 1 hour after speaking with her (the previous guests had just checked out and Housekeeping was starting on the room). We were moved to a Partial Ocean View (upgrade) with a Queen bed (small downgrade). Despite the new room only having a queen size bed, it was on a much higher floor (ie brighter!) with a tiny balcony. Location IS great but had it not been for Mona's warm hospitality and service, and the move to the new room, I can say that I would NOT have recommended this hotel. The room we stayed in made all the difference! FYI: the room itself comes with 2 small water bottles (upon initial check-in only). Amenities in the room include a small fridge and microwave. Free wifi. Lobby always has chilled water and pineapple iced tea, coffee / hot water, apples (usually), newspapers and a business centre. The hotel can arrange for an airport shuttle (cost 13 per person) on a smaller shuttle generally fewer stops. The pool is tiny and although it is on the rooftop - only has 4 sun loungers so these were often taken. My recommendation to management would be to also include some chairs (I do recognize it is a small surface area so there is not a lot of terrace room). Traveller tip: make sure you upgrade your room to one that is on a higher floor (so you don't need to see the nasty building next door) and get more of that Hawaiian sunshine you've come for!Aloha Frenchie,Thank you for your review. Traveling can be very difficult to many and although you were not pleased with your initial room Mona was more than happy to move you into a room more to your liking! Many travelers that stay with us simply use our hotel as a central home base if you will so that they are in the middle of everything without paying the exorbitant prices that many Waikiki hotels charge. Nonetheless we are pleased that you made the best of your Hawaiian vacation, happy travels.Mahalo,Jerome YapchingAssistant Front Office Manager
825	5	Excellent staff and location . I enjoyed my stay at this hotel . Fresh infused water and coffee all day long . Beach and restaurants at walking distance. specially Josh was very kind and helpful, answering all my questions !
826	1	Infected of fleas and thumbtacks, bedbags infected. The people of receipt know the problem and nevertheless it rents the rooms. Hotel to demand
827	1	This hotel is absolutely disgusting and is in violation of choice regulations. When we checked in there was excessive dried up pee and pubic hairs on our toilet. I contacted the staff immediately and I asked the old man behind the desk for a discount and he offered to clean it. He did state that it would take some time,... More
828	4	We stayed 2 nights: New Year's Eve and New year's day, and the location was ideal in the heart of Union Square. Saks 5th Ave is a few blocks away, Japantown is a brisk 15 minute walk...Friendly hotel staff, valet parking (35/night) The hotel is a quirky older building (not a bad thing), with dead-end corridors ending at full-height windows looking out onto the street, glass walls looking down into restaurant/common areas. Personality Hotel Group has added a modern sleek look to the whole place. Blue elevator buttons, stainless headboard that peels away to reveal the wall, Artemide night table swing arm lamps, simple modern shower fixtures all add to the industrial chic. The shower was strong, room had complimentary wireless, filing drawer dresser, writing desk, Swing-arm flat screen TV, bertoia diamond chairs, room safe, separate washsink area. Bathroom was a little small and tiles looked like they could use some cleaning and some grout. The bed was comfortable and room was clean, other than the bathroom tiles.Gym was small and a little depressing-blinds were pulled closed to hide the roof fans, gym door probably could have used glass so it didn't seem like you were working out in a prison gym.Business center was nice-I printed out directions to our Sonoma hotel.There is a Starbucks attached through the lobby and a mexican restaurant (we did not try, but looked upscale)Overall, a nice stay in an older building with some decent modern updates.How we got the best rate: 229 New Year's Eve, 129 Jan 1st. After searching around, we got the best rate by booking early on the Diva website directly.
829	4	I spent 6 nights here on a business trip recently, sharing with two friends. We found the price very reasonable, and the free wi-fi was great (compared the nearby big hotel, where we had our conference). Staff were very helpful and made good restuarant recommendations. Rooms a little small, and bathroom distinctly so, but there were not enough to affect what we thought was very good value for money. It is really good having the different public (small) lounges, where we had several meetings. Starbucks downstairs were always friendly too, and some very good, low price eating spots nearby.Dear 1Jozi,Thank you for sharing your experience at Hotel Diva with Trip Advisor. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us. I hope you will think of us once again on your next trip to San Francisco.We look ofrward to seeing you soon!Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
830	3	Reasonably priced for SF, especially if you need to do business in the City.Mediocre staff, limited amenities in the hotel.Worth it if you can't find a better price on Hotel Tonight but basically clean, functional but you are on your own for food. Not for kids.Dear Guy in London,Thank you for staying at Hotel Diva. Although our staff gets favorable reviews, I'm so sorry to hear your experience wasn't the same. We do have concierge services available for any restaurant reccommendations or reservations you may need. We also have a mexican bistro on site, Colibri also provides our room service.I hope you will give Hotel Diva another chance on your next visit to San Francisco.Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
831	5	This is a hidden gem in the Union Square area. There is an adjacent Starbucks for those who can't function without their morning java. The rooms are spacious, and some rooms come with a murphy bed. The dcor is clean and metropolitan, but the window shades have silhouettes of scantily-clad women which some might find unnecessary. The bathrooms, or shall I say toilet rooms have a shower/tub and toilet, while the actual sink is in the room itself. It's difficult not to wake your partner if you get up at night for water or brush your teeth. The staff was uber-friendly! The hotel itself is just steps away from shopping, fine dining, casual dining, and cable cars.Dear Valerie,Im glad to hear we met your expectations during your recent stay with us. Thank you for choosing Hotel Diva. We hope to see again soon.Warm regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
832	4	It was my first time in San Fran with my family and we stayed at Diva for 4 nights.We were quite satisfied with the stay as the hotel was in the center of union sq and it was very close to the shopping area and restaurants.The staff was kind and helpful as well.Dear Abhinavm33,Thank you for staying at Hotel Diva. I hope you and your family had a memorable first trip to San Francisco. We look forward to welcoming you back at Hotel Diva.Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
833	4	Hotel Diva doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you step in, this is a sleek, modern hotel, with great rooms, modern decor, excellent room amenities, and superb housekeeping. Front desk staff are excellent, and knowledgeable about San Francisco. The shower is particularly nice. The beds are quite comfortable. 7 minute walk to the Bart.Wow! Thank you for sharing your great Diva experience with us! We are happy to hear you enjoyed our hotel, excellent staff and comfy beds. We appreciate your feedback and hope to impress you on a future stay.
834	3	This hotel was not the adorable boutique it appears to be on the website. While it did have some modernistic styles to it, some of that was just plain weird and made the place feel cold. Neon blue lights in the elevators and metal sinks that made you feel like you were washing up in a garbage disposal! We were first given a Two Room Studio Queen and while the main room was fine, the one with the murphy bed was stark and creepy. I pulled down the murphy bed which had a thin sheet on it, not comphy blanket or pillow like the other bed. I asked housekeeping for towels and to make up the murphy bed and when we returned from our evening out, the towels were there on the unmade bed. I called again and the housekeeping but really a guy who looked like a maintenance man arrived and said what would you like me to do with a snarky tone. He pointed me to a closet w/pillows and a blanket. Excuse me, didn't realize I had to make my own bed at a hotel. I turned on the flatscreen and it was all snowy w/terrible reception. Off to a good start. The second night we switched to a regular room w/two queen sized beds. They told us which room to go to. Later we found the bathroom was not cleaned (you don't want to know...) as well as garbage left by previous guests. That TV also was difficult to see and the clock we were given was set on a completely wrong time and the ipod plug in didnt work. Speaking of my ipod (ipad) while there was free wi-fi, it was terrible and barely worked. I'm guessing they did clean the room the following nights b/c of the housekeeping knocks on the door while we were still sleeping in the morning. They may want to consider those little please do not disturb door hangers to solve that problem. To top it all off, there is an alley alongside the hotel that every night at about 3am bottle pick woke us up and kept us up as loud crashing noises filled our room! This place would be in big trouble if an actual diva ever showed up!
835	4	When pricing hotels, don't forget about the 50/night parking fee and the resort fee for this hotel. These will add about 75 per night to the listed price. Nice hotel and great location. However, if you don't care about modern furniture and a shot of saki between 5-7pm, then you can find cheaper hotels in the area of the same quality, such as the Mosser, through various travel websites. Thank you for taking the time to share your stay with us. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed our location and hotel. We apologize if you were unaware of the expensive parking rates in SF. Our valet is operated by Pro Park America and though the charge seems high, they are competitive with the surrounding hotels pricing in our area.

836	3	Surrounding does not feel safe as there are many homeless people roaming around, especially when you are travelling alone Location was great. Staff were friendly. Suggest that they can just add the additional facilities fees to the room rate instead of charging it when the guest check in. It will simplify the accounting documentation for business travelers.Thank you for taking the time to share your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear you loved our central location and friendly staff. We value all guest feedback and will review these comments with our team. We hope to welcome you back and impress you on a future stay. Thanks again.
837	4	Hotel Diva is a good hotel for SF. Many places are old or expensive. Diva maintains a funky vibe while being good value. Amenities are a bit lacking but there is a Starbucks next door which helps. Overall recommended.Tip - good local restaurant is Fish and Farm. The 7 x 7 burger is excellent.
838	1	Overpriced hotel for the quality they offer. The other guests were inconsiderate. The barhroom was so small it was ridiculous. The shower head had no power. It needs a professional make over, not one done by a jack of all trades person. Thank you for taking the time to share this unfortunate stay with us. We are very sorry to hear your visit was less than excellent and can assure you this is not what we strive to offer our guests. We will share these comments with our team and wish that your stay would have been more enjoyable. Thank you again for letting us know.
839	4	This hotel is conveniently located few mins away from Union square. The staff are friendly and helpful but it doesn't have any dining area. only a lobby and lift to the rooms. At the time of our visit there were redecoration work was being done but it never disturbed us. The room is clean but had a view of brick wall from the windows. Decent water pressure in bathroom. Separate sink for washing hands from the bathroom. The closet with weird cover of metal strings was annoying but OK. overall an OK place but not somewhere I would love to get back to! Oh, and parking was overpriced. We found nearby parking for much cheaper priceDear Guest, Thank you for sharing your experience with us! I am happy to hear you enjoyed both our fantastic location and staff - they really are a winning combination. On your next visit with us, you will have to try Colibri, our wonderful Mexican Bistro connected through our lobby. We do offer the valet, however if in-and-out access is not needed, there are close by options that are more cost efficient (through do not provide that access). I do hope we get to welcome you back on your next adventure to San Francisco!All the best, Tyler Layton
840	4	Overall, a very nice day. I was there on business and needed to be closed to the s s Center. The hotel was under a little bit of construction which was alarming at first but after day two I was very used to it and was not bothered at all. The staff is extremely friendly.Thank you for the kind comments on your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear our upgrades taking place did not bother you during your visit. We also love to hear our staff are extremely friendly as this is what we strive to offer all of our guests. We hope to have you back again soon.
841	4	The hotel is conveniently located a few blocks from Union Square and we like that the room has decent size as well. One thing to note, they charge 'mandatory' fee of 15/night and the reception told us that it covers Internet, concierge and others. Felt a bit disappointed that it is not included in the reservation fee and that it is 'mandatory'. The worst thing in our opinion of the hotel is the scent. The lift smells and hope that the management can do something about it. Other than the things we dislike above, the room has pretty good amenities and I personally love the shower gel they provided. However, the bathroom gets flooded very easily by the water that comes out from the shower head which easily spray beyond the tub. We think it's a pretty good hotel overall but will not come back unless the scents can be improved.Thank you for taking the time to share this feedback with us. We value all guest comments as it allows up the opportunity to improve. We will review this with our team and hope to have the chance to impress you on a future visit. Thanks again.
842	4	The Diva is in a great location close to the heart of San Francisco with easy access to Fishermans habour. The staff were friendly and accommodating. Easily accessed via public transport, bus and BART to and from the airport and tram or easy walk to Fishermans Habour. The room was small but as we were only in San Francisco for 2 nights it worked nicely for us. If you were planning on staying longer and needed more space I would contact the Diva directly and discuss options as they have larger rooms. Really enjoyed our stayThank you for being our guest and sharing your recent stay! We are pleased to hear you loved our central location for exploring the city and were well taken care of by our friendly staff. Your feedback means a lot to us and we hope to welcome you back again soon!
843	4	wait until is remodeled completely, right now under construction. A little uncomfortable because the noise and dust. Other than that I highly recomend it: location, cleanliness, service and prices. The beds are incredibly comfortableThank you for taking the time to share your stay with us, we are honored your chose our hotel for your special occasion. We are pleased to hear you found our beds super comfy and enjoyed our service and location. We greatly appreciate you recommending us to future travelers. We look forward to seeing you and your family next time.
844	3	I stayed here while in town for Dreamforce 2013. The location as great and couldn't be beat, it was close to Union Square and the street cars going to the Wharf. Sometimes there were a pan handlers outside the front door, but I noticed that was going on at most of the hotels so I am not sure that could be avoided by going elsewhere. The rooms were decent. Small, but everything you needed in a room. Unfortunately, I did not discover the fridge was in the desk until the day I was checking out. The fitness rooms is crowded if there are more than two people in it. I would stay here again.Dear AZHarris,Thank you for staying at Hotel Diva. I hope you enjoyed your stay with us. Although San Francisco has its share of panhandlers, I hope this will not deter you from returning to our beautiful city.We look forward to welcoming back at Hotel Diva.Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
845	5	From the wonderful greeting of the front desk staff to the comfortable bed in my quiet room, I loved every second of my stay! I was surprised coz I did not expect the room to be spacious enough! The hotel is walking distance to lots of restaurants, shopping, entertainment and the train station! And how wonderful it is that Union Square is just a block away!Wow! Thank you for taking the time to share this fabulous stay with us! We are thrilled to hear you loved our friendly staff, central location and comfy beds! Your feedback means a lot to us and we hope to welcome you back in the near future. Thanks again.
846	1	The bathroom was disgusting it was not cleaned, hair in the bathtub, cracked base, dirt, dust. Hotel is under renovation, the smell in the hallway is horrible. The noise was unbearable. The location is good, you can use this hotel to store your luggage...: nothing elseThank you for taking the time to review us. I am very sorry your stay was less than excellent. We take cleanliness very seriously and I will report this feedback to our team to help us improve. Thanks again.
847	3	Firstly, the staff were great, no issues there. Extremely friendly and attentive.My primary concerns had to do with the room appointments. I felt like the hotel had undergone a fairly recent conversion but more work towards soundproofing and modernization is in order. I stayed in a Junior Suite and I'm 6'1 and I felt like a giant in this room.The bathroom was very, very small. There were no vents or fans in the bathroom so moisture buildup was a definite issue. The room furniture while stylish was very low to the floor and not so functional or comfortable if you are taller.I slept in the murphy bed and I felt like it would have really benefitted from a good pillow-top pad addition, it was quite uncomfortable. The floors were very creaky and we could hear our adjoining neighbor's conversations quite clearly in the room.Also, there is a small inside courtyard but it's not accessible to any of the guests and rooms on this side are probably quieter but they are darker.Many of the guests (my party included) noticed that the elevators didn't indicate whether they were going up or down until you were in the elevator having selected the floors and it resulted in some unexpected travels. Valet parking is pricey at 40/night and they recommend calling about 30 mins before you need to leave and I'd heed that advice.At this hotel's price point, my expectations start to rise and while this hotel is an ok value for San Francisco, I think a little tweak here and there would go a long way in making this a solid mid-range hotel in Downtown SF.Dear Lightning79,Thank you for sharing your comments on Trip Advisor. We most certainly appreciate your feedback. Please be assured that we will look into the points you have mentioned on your review.We look forward to welcoming you back at Hotel Diva.Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
848	5	I can't sleep comfortably in a hotel if I don't feel my room is clean. The lobby, room, fitness center, and all the surroundings, were immaculate. All the staff was pleasant, there when you needed them. Called for additional items twice and there were knocks on my door within minutes. Affordable rates, great bang for your buck. Also centrally located, within walking distance to everything.
849	4	I love staying at Hotel Diva when I am in town. You are literally blocks away from touristy Time Square, but can also explore other neighborhoods of SF on your own 2 feet! The staff is very helpful and the rooms have modern decor and are a very decent size for the price. I am from SF and would have clients stay here, also. All have had rave reviews of their stay.
850	5	Had a wonderful deluxe king on the 7th floor (room 709) in the back of the building so it was nice and quiet. (Remember that in downtown SF, any room in any hotel that faces the street will be loud and noisy due to the noise on the street--no hotel can guard against this.) The room decor was nice and modern with a dash of whimsy. Plenty of hangers in the closet plus a small safe for my iPad and other valuables. Fabulous slanted bar glasses in the room--I want to find them for my home. The bathroom was huge with a private WC. I loved the PURE bathroom amenities--will also need to shop for these for my home. Staff was very friendly. They are doing some remodeling but it never bothered me. It is targeted to be done in September 2016. Great location near Union Square and BART/MUNI stops. Starbucks is right next door as is a good upper-scale Mexican restaurant with a great bar.WOW! Thank you for sharing your 5 star Diva experience with us! We are delighted to hear you found our rooms wonderful, staff friendly and location great! We really appreciate you taking the time to review us and look forward to seeing you again in the future!
851	5	Great location, room very clean, bathroom small but the room was huge with a full size pull down double for our son and a king for us, plus room for a coffee table with 3 chairs. Nicely decorated. Friendly staff especially concierge who is a real character but really helpful and friendly. We got a room on the 7th floor opening out onto a central tiny courtyard/well so no view but no street noise either which was very nice. No more homeless people outside than anywhere else so no problem there. Easy walk from Union square 2 blocks and a manageable walk from BART on Montgomery even with cases, we left our car with friends in Berkely to avoid the cost of parking. Caught the street car to FIshermans Wharf but got a taxi back to the hotel which was only 11 and well worth it as it got very cold and we were really tired by then. Starbucks in the lobby and a great takeaway Thai noodle bar 2 shops away. Would definitely stay again.

855	5	We stayed at Hotel Zephyr with our two kids ages 8 and 12 back in February. We loved all this hotel has to offer, both in location and fun amenities. We loved the dart board in our hotel room and have looked everywhere for one like it for our own home. The game room, patio and all the fun places to sit and relax are fantastic. They didn't seem to have any board games etc...but there was plenty to do with shuffle board, ping pong etc. We hope to come back again in a year or two. Thanks Hotel Zephyr!!Greetings jam0nes,You are most welcome. Thank you for sharing your amazing memories of your stay at Hotel Zephyr. We have added several new games to the game room since February, come back and see us again...hopefully sooner than a year or two.
856	3	I booked this hotel last minute through a 3rd party site and paid about 75 less than advertised. However, I still thought it was overpriced for the cleanliness and maintenance of the property.I did call the hotel the day before to see if they would meet the online price or if they'd offer a different last minute discount. The girl in reservations couldn't have cared less about why I was visiting or anything I had to say. She was very obviously reading off a script and refused to break it (not even to gain relationship with a potential guest). I questioned even booking because of her, but decided not to let one person sour my opinion of the business. Good:The location is fantastic for touristy things. Just a couple blocks from Pier 41 and 39. Easy walk to Alcatraz ferry. Convenient to many public transport lines.When I came in to check in, a gentleman welcomed me right away and made sure I was in the correct line. The room was very spacious. Though it was just me, they put me in a room with 2 double beds. There was ample space around all the furniture to move around. There was a mini fridge, Keurig (with coffee, cream, tea, decaf, etc), and bottled water. There was a fold down seat in the shower which would be a great amenity for someone who has a hard time standing long enough to shower. The TV was huge and they provided a great cheat sheet on how to use it. The hotel provided coupons for local restaurants. Very cute nautical decorations. The seagull pillows were adorable. Not so good:Cleaning was only okay. There was trash on the floor, hair in the shower, and rust from a leaking toilet that easily wiped off. It was loud, but I'm not sure what from. There was a banging, almost construction noise that would happen fairly often day and night. I was able to sleep through it. None of the staff knew much about the area other than the handful of places they all pushed. There was a very rough around the edges feel with peeling paint, damaged wallpaper, etc.There was no mattress cover. There was just a thin protector on top of the mattress and then the sheet. This seems odd for a hotel.The provided shampoo and conditioner did not work well. To be fair, I did not make the hotel aware of my dissatisfaction with any of these items during my stay thus not providing an opportunity to fix anything. I would stay here again for 1 or 2 nights. It was comfortable and conveniently located. Dear greenbeanjean26,Thank you for such a detailed review of your experience while staying at Hotel Zephyr. I am truly embarrassed by having missed some simple details of your guest room. If you have a chance, I invite you to email me directly GMhotelzephyrsf.com and share your room number or reservation details so that I can be sure I inspect and address details of the room you stayed in. We work hard to make sure we leave everyone with positive memories and would have been happy to make this right while you were with us. I am glad that you would give us a chance again in the future and hope to see you soon.
857	4	We stayed at the Zephyr for a long weekend and it was a great hotel for coming and going. Nice courtyard with fire pits going, bring your own wine and relax in a friendly atmosphere. It's not pretentious and it's still 'styling'
858	3	We were traveling to visit family with two school-age children. We booked the Radisson for two reasons: first, to try a Sleep Number bed because I'd like to convince my better half to buy one, and second, because it had a heated outdoor pool. Now that it's the Hotel Zephyr, both the pool and the sleep number beds are gone. Now it's modern, hip, and trendy - great if you're twentysomething looking for fun, but somewhat less appealing to us old and stodgy thirtysomethings.Had the hotel contacted us in advance, I would've rebooked somewhere else. But since they didn't contact me despite having my phone number, address, and email, we were stuck. The desk clerk was witchy (ma'am, I can't build a Radisson for you) but the front office manager was much kinder, recognizing it does stink to not be aware of the huge change in the hotel's target demographic and style prior to arrival and upgrading us in response.The beds are hard and the rooms are small, but everything was clean, fresh, and new with the recent renovation. The pool area is now a courtyard, the theme of which is actually junk: old shipping containers line the area, the sculptures are flaming old cathode ray tube tv sets, and crumpled aluminum cans are used as decor. Very post-apocalyptic chic. Again, cute if you're 20, but eye-roll inducing closer to 40. Unless you love to decorate out of the neighbors' recycling bins.The rooms do have cushioned window seats which are perfect for watching the fog roll in - we could see Alcatraz from our room. And the location is great, close to restaurants, shops, and the piers. As long as you're planning to spend a lot of time out seeing the city, this will serve as a reasonable home base due to the fantastic location.Dear KC,Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay with us!Yes, we are definitely not the Radisson anymore. Our property underwent a 32 million dollars renovation where the hotel got transformed from top to bottom in order to create our brand new property, Hotel Zephyr. In this transformation we didn't leave anything undone, thus our rooms were completely remodeled and upgraded all the way, including a higher quality of brand new mattresses. Our public spaces were also completely redesigned, our interior lobby got expanded over 5,000 sq feet opening directly to our brand new outdoor lounge area, the yard! all and all creating 11,600 sq of indoor/outdoor interactive space where we encourage our guests to let loose and have fun. That thought of going back to your childhood, embracing a sense of adventure and discovery was an essential part of the designer's inspiration while creating the fresh and fun environment in our hotel and specially in the yard. She used unexpected materials, from recycled corrugated metals and cargo containers to upcycled nautical materials and shipping crates, scrap transformed into treasure at every corner to evoke that childlike sense of excitement that comes with a great adventure regardless of your age! KC, I am glad to hear that you enjoyed our prime location and phenomenal views very much and that our front office manager was able to upgrade your accommodations as he continued to service you all the way during your stay to make it as enjoyable as possible for you in true Zephyr service spirit!Warm regards, Carmen CruzGeneral Manager
859	5	We loved Hotel Zephyr! It's a very unique hotel right in Fisherman's Wharf. I appreciated the email they sent before our arrival asking us if we had any special requests - Was this a special occasion Extra towels or pillows needed etc. By posting our booking with them on Facebook, we were given a voucher for a free upgrade upon availability. Corinne and Bernadette were wonderful at the front desk, they not only honored our upgrade and gave us a balcony room facing the Bay, but kept us on the same floor with our friends we were traveling with. When we arrived to our room, there was a welcome note from the staff wishing us an enjoyable first time to San Francisco. We enjoyed the ambience of the outdoor area every night and even played some of the games provided. We were very happy with the housekeeping, concierge and all the staff, plus we loved the great location. We highly recommend Hotel Zephyr!The Z team is always here to make you feel at home, Kim C! We are all about creating memories for our guests and loved having you with us for your first time to our great city. Can't wait to do it all over again! Until next time...Cheers, James
860	5	We stayed at the Zephyr for a week at a really good price and were impressed. The hotel is uniquely decorated and has numerous old-school/classic games in and around it...most with somewhat of a twist. The staff were all tremendously respectful and helpful from check-in to check-out. We brought a small issue with our original room to Lauren and she happily re-accommodated us.The Zephyr is centrally located with easy walking access to a lot of SF's tourist and food spots..it was really convenient.The only negatives I'd say are that the fridge size is deceiving. It looks like a medium sized fridge from the outside but when you open it, the actual fridge is teeny tiny so there isn't much room for stuff. And, the parking was expensive.Overall though, we had a great time and enjoyed our stay at the Zephyr..and we know where to stay if we decide to visit SF again.You certainly got to live like a local, Cecilio L! We love sharing our local go to spots so our guests get the true SF experience, after all that's why we travel! Come see us on your next adventure to the city. Cheers, James
861	3	We stayed in this hotel several times when it was a Radisson. The location is perfect for us since we are visiting family in the Marina district and we like to tour the city by public transportation. Perhaps I shopped poorly this time for a deal on a room, but we paid well over 400 per night for a room that was called a deluxe double/double. It didn't seem like a deluxe anything. Yes, it did have a partial view of the Bay but it had a much better view of the noisy parking lot and the windows of other peoples' rooms. I had asked for a quiet room and was tolf this room was quiet. Yet it turned out to be right next to the elevator. Go figure. The room had nice amenities (upscale coffee pot and coffee, a mini-refrigerator) but it was very small and cramped, even with only two of us. The bathroom needed a good cleaning. For this kind of money, I expect a room to be really clean and this one wasn't. The hotel has been renovated recently which is nice, but much of the workmanship is quite shoddy and may not hold up very well. The hotel offers no room service, no coffee service in the lobby in the mornings as best I could tell, and has no bar at all. Even given how expensive hotel rooms are in San Francisco, I expected a lot more for this kind of money. The front desk staff was very nice however. Be aware that the few elevators available are very slow and small. You might want to leave extra time to get to the lobby with luggage at checkout time. I hate to give up staying at this location but I don't believe we get our moneys' worth at the price we paid.
862	5	This property festively greeted guests with Super Bowl balloons, decorations, Broncos Panthers pop up cut outs in the lobby and football shaped cups in the suites! Staff members are friendly every morning welcoming guests to breakfast buffet included in the room rate. The fresh fruit full of various berries was outstanding! They continued replenishing items even 15 minutes prior... More
863	4	On a whim we decided to drive up to Napa from San Francisco for a few days. Unfortunately, most of the hotels Yountvilee, St. Helena, etc. were booked. So we decided to try the Ivy Hotel by Best Western. And what a great surprise! The rooms were huge and very comfortable (all recently remodeled), and the location was great. We were literally 10 minutes from Youtnville yet we only paid half the price of staying in Yountville. If you want to see Napa but not pay a fortune to do it - this place is for you. And there is a great restaurant two blocks away (Fume)....make sure you check that out too.
864	3	Nice location, nice looking hotel, but needs some sound proofing! I was in a King room just off the elevator lobby, which is marble, could hear people talking outside and in the room next to us as if they were in our room. Doors slam shut so hard we woke up every time our neighbor came in or out. Room was nice size, bed was a little hard for my taste. Great view from our 24th floor room. Don't think I would stay here again unless there is an update to the building in terms of sound proofing. Valet was overwhelmed the day we arrived (large convention in the hotel) It took a trip around the block since we drove past the line of cars waiting, and a 20 minute wait to get parked. Elevators were over taxed at busy times due to a full hotel and busy convention. Staff was great and friendly.Thank you for your recent stay at the Loews Philadelphia Hotel. I am glad you liked the property and our backyard. I am sorry to hear you did not get a decent night sleep due to the noise. When you return to the hotel, we can place you in a room at the end of the hall which will help as well as ear plugs are available complimentary from the Front Desk. Thank you again for your review and we hope to host you again soon.
865	4	The hotel is great and the refurbishment is outstanding. Very large rooms with nice amenities. Downside is that they don't tell you that they require a 100 per day hold on your credit card for miscellaneous incidentals until you check in. That being said, they charged me 600.00 instead of 300.00 and then took 3-5 business days to refund. Due to their error their staff has offered to refund any issues this caused with bank/credit card. Overall the area and the hotel were great, but several guests at our conference had similar charging experiences.Thank you for your recent stay at the Loews Philadelphia Hotel. While I am pleased to hear you enjoyed our large rooms and nice amenities, I apologize for the issues you encountered with incidental charges. Thank you again for your review and we hope you will afford us another opportunity with a return visit in the future.

870	4	Nothing spectacular. Good hotel. Kinda in the middle of stateline and actual SLT so walking seems kinda a pain. I thought they had redone the pool building entirely, but it was just a new facade. The rooms look bad, the best was uncomfortable, the wifi was inconvenient, the outlets only half worked.
871	4	Very clean, friendly staff and very comfortable rooms. We are staying here because of a deal with a Spanish summer course, and we are very happy with our stay. Pool is a little small, but we are right across from the lake.
872	5	My daughter and I came up to Tahoe to see Keith Urban and wanted a nice room and hopefully with lake views. We couldn't have asked for any better.

873	5	If you are going to South Lake Tahoe to relax, enjoy the weather and beach and want to avoid the casino area this is the perfect place. Request a room with a view of the lake in the newer building. Clean, quiet, aircon, wifi, parking, convenience to everything and a beach right outside the door. What more would you want
874	4	Awesome. We really had a peaceful and comfortable stay. Location is convenient and walking distance to the park and lake. We Will recommend this place to friends and family. We will make this our spot for our trips in South Lake Tahoe.

881	4	Above average quality Inn. Not the newest hotel in town, however you can tell that it is well maintained . Full hotel, yet heard very little noise. Staff was pleasant. At southern end of town but close to everything. Would stay there again.
882	4	Capitola Venetian Hotel is a great place to stay. We were a family of 4 adults and a child. Kitchen was nice except should have had a larger table to eat on. Bathroom very small..but it served its function. Location great. Staff awesome and very accommodating. Would stay here again!!

Our team looks forward to show you that we are Here For You! Looking forward to seeing you on your next visit. CH
887	4	As others have detailed, this hotel has a wonderful modern decor, is very clean, rooms have a mini kitchen, bed is extremely comfortable and breakfast is nothing short of amazing and it's free so I won't repeat all of those details. Let's talk, instead about some of the criticisms previously mentioned and the surprises. Customer service from valet to front... More
888	3	Good place to stay, just wish we didn't have room directly facing highway. Could hear traffic all night long. Also was on a hallway with a party that went on into the early morning hours. If we go back again I will request room on back part of hotel. I will also call the police the next time I have... More
889	4	We were very pleased with our accommodations at this hotel. But were disappointed that there was no Gideon bible anywhere. Also, tried to use cash at check in but it was a hassle. They finally allowed us to use cash but they didn't really want to. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay there very much. Very clean and comfortable.
890	4	Nice facility. When making my reservation, the front desk misspelled my first name. Uoon check in I have my corrected spelling however it was never corrected. Room verty nice and bed comfortable. Would not recommend the restaurant located in the hotel. What I ordered was unpleasant.
891	3	The staff at this Best Western was very friendly and welcoming, but I can't say that this was the quality property that I have seen at other Best Western Hotels that have been given the plus designation. I have stayed at four other Best Western properties in two other states. They appear to be working through renovations and they seem... More
892	5	We opted to pay a little more to stay here instead of a cheaper hotel. They upgraded us to a suite no questions asked, the room was clean and in great shape, it was quiet, and they had a nice pool with a hot tub. The breakfast was good (they serve hot food) which saved us money. I cannot say... More
893	5	Great stay! Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Surrounding area very clean and safe. Gym onsite but also access complimentary access to lifetime fitness across the street........complimentary breakfast.
894	2	We stayed at this hotel only because we had an early flight in the morning and needed a cheap place to stay. The planes are loud but the neighbors were louder. A lot of people were there for the same reason as us and checking in late and up all hours. The staff was not too friendly or helpful. At... More
895	4	We stopped at this comfort inn because it was convenient to our route to get back home to Florida. We were puzzled why there was so many hotels in this town. It is in the middle of nowhere. It's the crossroads of all directions hence the wealth of choice in hotels. The hotel is in the middle of major renovations... More
896	4	We (5 adults and and 3 dogs) in one of the condos which is also attached to the main office. 2 bedrooms. 1 with king bed has a bathroom (stand alone shower) in room. the other bedroom was maybe a full size. and 2nd bathroom (huge tub) available for all. Full size kitchen with some pots,pans, utensils provided. Nice living... More
897	5	From the moment I walked in to see if this was the place my husband booked. I was greeted with a smile the gentlemen were professional. Our room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was hot and fresh and the woman was really nice. Pool/hot tub area was refreshing. We had a great stay and will recommend this place to our... More
898	3	Like everyone else says, this is a hotel for those on a budget. The pictures of the hotel are a bit misleading, including those showing the insides and pool etc. However, once you navigate your way around what is essentially a block of flats, the rooms are a pleasant surprise and are actually the best part of the hotel. Making your own breakfast loses its appeal after 1 day, especially when the cereal machines werent working and the staff on duty dont really understand english too well. however, you are close to many of the 3/4.99 breakfast buffets so its not really a problem. we were dismayed to find how easily the staff coud get assess to the safes in your room after our battery ran out and they took nearly 45mins to come up to our room (after repeated warning that we were in a hurry). as i said, the room is great though and we weren't really affected by loud crowds. if you want great service and english speaking (as a first language), don't stay here but if you don't mind it for the amount of time you'll be in room, it'l do just fine. free wifi as well. just remembered....the day we checked out and left our luggage in the 'secure' area, we got the feeling that it wasn't so as the hotel employed no way of identifying your bag so anyone could have lifted ours but thankfully we had locks.
899	2	We were flying in at midnight and looking for an inexpensive place to stay. We found it and it was close to Universal Studios our destination the next day. It is an old hotel and looks dirty, but it wasn't that bad. However, the information on another site said that they offer shuttle services to Universal - true, but not until 12 noon. We were told we could walk 15-20 minutes to get there. We had a rental so we just took it and glad we did because the walk back after all day at the park would have been horrible. We also did not have enough towels/washcloths and asked for more. We did get towels and was told they would bring the washcloths. They never arrived. When we checked out she remembered we asked and when I said we did not get them, she said they must have been busy and forgot. The ice machines were out of order and just not a place I would stay again.
900	2	Location, location, location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 211. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!
901	3	We stayed almost a week in this hotel, by february The staff was very gentle to me and my family, the room was located at third floor, a big one with all services working well and clean. NIce location, near to Universal Studios parks.
902	4	We stayed in this hotel or motel, because we were on a budget. And it really served its purpose. We prefered have more money to spend on dinners and on the parks, than to spend it in a hotel room that its only use is to get a good shower and a good night's sleep. It served just that. It was really practical. The staff were REALLY friendly, the parking was really safe, they monitered all cars, to make sure you were their guests. Checking in was a breeze. We were placed on the third floor, and it had a beautiful view to the Island of Adventure's Hulk and Towers. Its your average room, with average bed and furniture. The beds were comfortable, and plenty of sheets and pillows. There is a safe available free of charge, but you have to ask the key in the front desk. The safe is big enough to put your Ipad and documents. The towels could use an upgrade. There is a tv, with local channels. The A/C worked fine and it didnt make any funny noises. We even had to lower the temperature at some point. There is a mini fridge that worked superb! We went to Walmart and bought bottle of waters for the parks and we put in snacks as well. Housekeeping was pretty good some days, other days they just forget to put enough towels. The lighting in the room was pretty bad. The bathroom light sometimes came on, other times we dependend on the light of the room. Another weird detail is that the hotel room key is not your average magnetic key... It worked like a hard plastic card with weird holes. So if you loose that key, it would become troublesome to get an easy replacement. The telephone didnt work, and yes.. No wifi in room. The ice machine does cost you an extra fee, like .25 per bucket... But since we had bottles of ice cold water, that wasnt an issue. We didnt have any hidden fee, and it was a really great stay. Easy to locate and very centric in the International Drive. Close to everything: restaurants, parks, gas stations, outlet malls, cinema. GREAT, GREAT LOCATION!!!! About 20 min to Disney Parks, and 3 min car drive to Universal Studios Parks If you have simple needs, this is really your place to stay! Would recommend, and would stay again in a heartbeat! :) great christmas vacations in Orlando.
903	1	Ice machine broken, telephone broken, ice bucket dirty, run down hotel, overall stinky ordor, great customer service and guest services I would not recommend my enemies to this hotel..Please renovate soon.
904	4	Awesome experience they let us check in 2 hours earlier .. Nice room very clean for a cheap price a good choice...i mean you dont even spend the day at the hotel so why pay too much for it This hotel was exaclty what we needed and the pool was pretty nice too
905	3	It's not a place you would want to stay in all day every day. But somewhere that you least at 7 in the morning and return to, at 9-10pm at night, and pretty much just sleep in it's fine.Yes the rooms/service areas could do with redecorating.The carpets particularly need to be properly cleaned or replaced.However the room was clean, my bed was made with fresh sheets every day, and the bathroom was spotless.
906	1	This is the 3rd time I have been to Florida and the 1st ...and last time I will stay at the Orlando Continental!!My party was 5 adults and the room did have two double beds which was fine, but my 16 yr old son had to sleep on a rollaway camp style bed with his legs hanging off the edge!!The air con, was up the creek and was either too hot or too cold and very very noisy! Every day when we came back to the room after visiting the theme parks the walls were wet, all our clothes were wet and the beds were wet!Our view from the room window was a blank wall and therefore the room was always dark.The free breakfast in the morning was a joke, with a free for all for the toast, fighting for seating and a real cattle market. The pool was very small and you could not swing a cat in the games room (I use the term 'games' loosely) because the room is about 6ft by 4ft!).To be fair the only 'good' point with this hotel is the location. It is right on International Drive and takes about 30 seconds to get to wet n wild so you can walk there and save on parking.I ended up staying one extra night in florida, so I stayed in the Holiday Inn which is also on International Drive, about 500m up the road. What a pleasure! I thought I was in Heaven!!In conclusion, I would say, only stay here if you really really really don't mind the quality of the hotel and want a cheap hotel to rest your head at night.
907	4	If the weather is good, this is the place to go to get a 360 view of McMinnvillle and surrounding area. Amazed we could even see Mt. Hood! Good service and good selection of drinks. We did not eat here.
908	5	Perfect place for a quick get away. We had a queen room with a shared bathroom. Bed was extremely comfortable and the room was surprisingly quiet. There were ear plugs in our room, but we didn't need them even though we were on the fourth floor right below the roof top bar. Staff was great, very informative and helpful. We... More
909	5	We dined here for lunch and were amazed at the UFO history. This is a really FUN place and the food and service were outstanding. A nice way to spend a couple of hours.
910	4	Me and a friend stayed here on the last leg of our 6 week American adventure for 3 nights. When we arrived the first receptionist was quite short and boderline rude however the manager took over (Gutted I can't remember his name) and he could not have been more helpful. We had a few conversations with him and he was a genuinely lovely man who couldn't have been more helpful.There are no lifts in this hotel, however the aforementioned manager helped us up the many stairs with our luggage. I have never stayed in a shared bathroom hotel before but it was not as bad as I envisioned. They were always immaculate and never too much of a wait as there were 3 toilets on our floor.I would say if you are a younger traveller this may not be the hotel for you as we did get told off for laughing too loudly with some travellers from neighbouring rooms, however this was completely justified, just if you're after a more lively scene, pick a hotel with sound proofed rooms! There are no TV's in the room's and they are quite small but if, like us, you are after a relaxed vibe when you get in, this is great. (Another reviewer compared this hotel to 'staying at grandma's' and I couldn't agree more)The location of the hotel was absolutely perfect. In some parts of San Fran I did feel slightly unsafe but could not fault the location of the San Remo at all, a quieter, friendly area. Opposite there is a great little cafe, Caffe Cappiccio (Helpful as the hotel does not provide a breakfast), some bars (our favourite being La Rocas) and a 10 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf. The restaurant of the hotel was absolutely brilliant. The food was delicious and there was a fantastic band playing while we were eating who also did a great rendition of happy birthday to my friend.All in all, this hotel was a great little find and I would love to see what the penthouse is like!Again, thank you to the manager, your customer service was impeccable.Thank you so much for your comments and feedback. Our staff are well-trained and expected to help our guests above and beyond, just like Kenley (our manager) did. We will look into the front desk staff you mentioned, as we are in the hospitality business and expect the best from our staff.Besides being close to many famous attractions, our neighborhood is very safe. We are very glad that you felt comfortable walking around here. The Fior d'Italia is America's oldest Italian restaurant and our guests get 10 discount. We hope you will choose to stay with us again in your next trip to the US.
911	5	This unique old Victorian hotel is amazing. The no frills way of staying. No TV, small rooms, just FAB. Fresh coffee and tea every morning. Access to their computer and free wifi. The showers and toilets are VERY clean and warm towels are provided. It can get noisy on trash day, since there is an alley on one side. But overall what great experience. My new home away from home.
912	3	I went there with my BFFL and she fell in love with it after 3 seconds... I'm still trying to warm up to it. It had the cozy, heartwarming and pittoresque appeal, But when the first love ended you stood there short of Oxytocin and felt the cramped space that minutes before seemed enough. The Window in the room that seemed so corky at first, facing the corridor outside the room to small to let enough oxygen into the room at night. And the wash basin in the corridor that was sooo 19th century be actually a way of the past. The bed was adequate but a tad to small for more than newlyweds. I will not do this ho(s)tel again. But my roomy she would wanna be buried there!Thank you for your honest review. In an era of selfishness and cynicism, close quarter and having to share your space, let alone your thoughts with someone else, could be daunting. But life 100 years ago was not all about yourself.We are a beautifully preserved historic hotel, where many romantic stories, honeymoons and weddings have been celebrated. Notwithstanding our old world layout and style, we stand decade after decade, 11 total. This year we are celebrating our 110 anniversary, and that is cause for much Oxytocin!!
913	4	This little hotel offers one of the most relaxing atmospheres I've experienced, without the cost or the high end attitudes. The staff were so very helpful and friendly. We arrived early, and they had a secure area to store our bags and maps waiting at the front along with cucumber infused water and fresh coffee. While this is not like the usual Hilton style, I prefer this setting to any large chain hotel. The location was absolutely perfect....just a couple blocks from Little Italy and China Town, restaurants, the wharf, etc. Love it! Thank you San Remo!!!!
914	5	This was our second visit to The San Remo. For us, it's the perfect place to stay in San Francisco. The hotel is just a few minute walk from Pier 39 for shopping and restaurants. It's also only minutes away from any tour you'd like to take, whether you want to catch a boat to Alcatraz or ride a Segway on Lombard St. When you return from a tiring day of sightseeing, there are refreshments in the lobby! Coffee, tea and ice water along with an assortment of sweets are complimentary, as are the massage chairs on each floor. Downstairs is the oldest Italian restaurant in the U.S. The Fior d'talia is a delicious place for dinner and has a great jazz band on Wednesday nights. The staff at the San Remo are friendly and helpful and always smiling. Don't let the fact that the washrooms are down the hall dissuade you from staying here, they are spotlessly clean and we never had to wait for a shower. The towels are even warmed for you!
915	5	Lovely decor, lots of wood, lots of plants. Very romantic. The hotel is extremely well kept and spotlessly clean. However, the rooms are minuscule, the beds are small, the walls are thin and the floors crack. The location is very touristic (Fisherman's wharf). Still, it's a wonderful place and a great value.
916	5	I can't say enough to praise this hotel.They have thought of everything that you would need to make a leisure trip enjoyable from here. The staff are welcoming, friendly approachable and have your needs at the heart of their focus. They gave very good advice...More

921	4	I enjoyed my stay. Quiet so i could sleep during the day after a long nights work. Friendly staff and clean. Near food and sopping lotsof parking and tesla charging stations. Non smoking so that was a big plus. The down side is it fost extra to have a refrigerator in your room. Towels were a bit rough
922	5	After staying at the worst hotel I had ever been to (TownPlace Suites) last night, I hopped on the internet this morning and booked a room at Nylo. It is a beautiful hotel with gorgeous rooms. Very contemporary! The LOCL bar and restaurant is in the lobby-I ran down to get a quick carry out dinner to take back to... More
923	5	One hot Sunday in August our AC broke and the house was a solid 87 degrees. We were told a repair man wouldn't be able to make it to the house until Monday morning. We also had a 3 month old baby at the time. As a new mom I was about on my last leg and I told my... More
924	5	Super clean, plenty of parking, safe and quiet. The big minus: Breakfast at 7:00 is too late for me. About 6:30 guys
925	5	This is a great new Hotel and the staff are very friendly. Breakfast is great, even omelettes on Fridays. Hotel rooms are very clean and comfy beds. Pool was heated to a nice temperature. I would stay here again and again!
926	5	My wife had a conference in nearby Marysville and Trip Advisor's rating if this hotel led us to trying it out. We were greeted by friendly staff, who agreed to match the Trip Advisor on-line rate without hesitation. We were impressed with cleanliness of the hotel and it's in a great location. There is a Safeway across the street, Starbucks... More
927	4	Great new hotel near Marysville. The hotel is clean and quiet. The hotel is close to Costco, Target, Seattle Premium Outlets, many restaurants and the Tulalip Resort and Casino. We would stay here again!
928	4	The hotel is new, clean and well managed. The night clerk was friendly and efficient and the room was larger than I had expected. With the sofa bed it was comfortable for 5 people. Morning breakfast buffet served in the lobby area.
929	1	Bed Bugs !! Motel very old tired. Impossible to fall back to sleep after being eaten alive by bed bugs. Left in early morning hours and sealed my luggage in plastic bag! Motel close to Saratoga Racetrack and the racing season during August fill all the hotels and rates double. Stay away from this motel.
930	5	I was on my way to Denver and stopped here and everything was clean and staff was friendly. They have a bunch of discounts available on local restaurants. Everything is brand-new in the rooms and you swear this isn't a no chain hotel. I would recommend anyone staying here.
931	4	Fantastic customer service! Free breakfast, great TV and rooms are spacious. Mini fridge, microwave and most important hair dryer, and iron and board in room!! Stayed here 4 nights. No complaints at all.
932	3	We stayed here in a vacation visit to Seattle. About 10 blocks from the waterfront, convenient if you don't mind the walk downhill (and the return uphill). Room was older but in good condition and comfortable.Good Morning Traveler - Thank you for your review! We appreciate the feedback and we're happy to learn your enjoyed your stay. We hope to welcome you again if your travels bring you back to Seattle. Safe travels!
933	4	I had made reservations months before. Because of that we got a good price and felt that we had saved 75-100 a night instead of being closer to the downtown area of Seattle. From our searching, we felt it was one of the best deals in Seattle for price and location. The room was clean, good sized. We thought because it was by the Medical Center we would hear sirens all the time. That did not happen. It has a lovely lobby, a dining room for breakfast, lunch and dinner and in addition an outside beautiful dinning patio . The only draw back is they dont have air conditioning. But they do provide fans. Staff were very attentive. We would got back. Bathroom was large. We loved the area. You can get to the Starbuck Roastery by walking. Also straight down the street in front of the inn takes you to the Wharf section of Seattle. It is a pretty good hike or an easy Uber ride. We love to walk and so found it a great neighborhood. They also have a patio on the roof. If in Seattle again we would definately stay there. We were leaving for a cruise and they were very helpful with transportation issues to the docks.Hi Traveler - We're are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us! We remain an affordable option for visitors to Seattle. Please consider us your home away from home if (or should we say when) your travels bring you back to the area.
934	2	We stayed at this hotel last night while my grandfather was hospitalized because it was attatched to the Virginia Mason Hospital. The floors were so dirty that u could see the dirt sitting on top of the carpet, the mirrors were covered in dirty streaks, and the tub was full of leftover residue from recently removed no-skid strips! I have never been in a dirtier hotel room and am absolutely appalled that it is attatched to such an amazing hospital. The front counter staff was very kind and helpful but the state of the room was unbelievable. The toilet seat nearly slid off when I sat down and the wall plugs look like they're from the 1940s as we couldn't keep a single charger from falling out of the wall. It was an absolute waste of money I have spent nights in rooms that were half the price and twice as nice. Don't waste your money here - spend the night at one of the nicer hotels that are only 5 minutes down the road for less money and a better experience.Good morning. Thank you for your comments. As you can tell from previous trip advisor reviews, your stay is not the typical experience our guests enjoy. I have shared your comments with our housekeeping team - while the rooms are older, our staff works very hard to ensure rooms are thoroughly cleaned. It was a very busy weekend in Seattle and we are proud we are able to offer an affordable alternative for guests and family members seeking medical care. We hope your grandfather is feeling better. Good luck in your future travels, Carol Gallagher
935	5	very clean and with convenient supplies to enable us to prepare our own meals, we rested well while on difficult family business. The kitchenette had all the necessaries and the room was comfortable and quiet with a separate sleeping area for additional family members

943	1	From start to finish it was disgusting. dust, construction, tiny bathrooms, such a let down and waste of money. I totally was shocked because it was not at all what was pictured. I would suggest you call before arriving.
944	5	This hotel was terrific and very comfortable and clean. The health club with a lap pool and sauna was a necessary bonus. The restaurant on the 19th floor was lovely and the food was great. It's location is central and easily metro accessible.Thank you for choosing The Bellevue Hotel during your recent visit to Philadelphia! We appreciate your kind feedback and hope to see you again soon. Kindest regards, Michelle G.
945	3	The guestroom was average. It felt rather cold due to lots of empty space. Management may wish to add some furniture and accessories to make the rooms feel warmer.Unfortunately, our room location was near the elevator so throughout the night we heard beeping and the running of the motor for the elevator car. The bathroom was dated and needs a refresh. It could've been a little cleaner as well.Notwithstanding the above, the hotel's location is excellent. It's near many of the local attractions including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell center, shopping on Walnut Street and local restaurants. Also on the positive side, the common areas of the hotel are very well maintained and a pleasure to walk through. We stayed at a hotel because we were attending a wedding and the hotel catering was very good. The event people did a great job. While we are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your event and found our location convenient, we apologize if our guest room did not meet your expectations. These suggestions have been passed along our Housekeeping team in order to improve our practices. Thank you very much for your feedback, it is much appreciated!Kindest regards,Michelle G.
946	5	A great place to stay. A good location in the centre of Philadelphia with friendly staff who make you feel very welcome. Good facilities such as the sports centre and bar XIX on the top floor. Comfy bed.Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt at The Bellevue. We're glad to hear that you enjoyed our top floor XIX (NINETEEN) Restaurant and room accommodations. Our hotel is located in the best spot in Philadelphia just minutes away from all the attractions, and next to the Broad Street Subway Line which is a quick ride to all the Stadiums/Universities.We hope to welcome you back to Philadelphia soon and please follow us on Twitter bellevuephillyKind regards,CR

948	4	Attended a birthday party in the Grand Ball Room.. The food was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!!! Hats off to the banquet staff and the chief. My overnight guest room experience was also very good. The room was clean and roomy. My bed was super comfy. The breakfast buffet that morning was also very impressive. I would stay again.
949	3	The Waterfront Place Hotel has an excellent location right by a gorgeous walking/biking path. The hotel itself is very pleasant. Our room for 2 adults and 2 kids was spacious and comfortable. All hotel staff were polite and very helpful. There were two problems. The first problem was that hotel rates on a WVU game weekend exceeded what I recently... More
950	4	Stayed here for a business meeting. Great location near downtown and right on the river trail. Convenient walk to local restaurants and breweries. Parking is provided at not cost. I highly recommend it.
951	1	I booked a room here through a booking site. Apparently the price they gave was wrong and the manager made sure I understood that he was doing me the biggest favour in the world by letting me pay the quoted price: 'I could have cancelled it, you know', is what he said. He then gave me a room with a broken lock and no key, so every time I had to go out, I had to explain this all over again to whoever was at reception, and who would then go up VERY reluctantly to unlock the door for me. The people next door to me were a bunch of intimidating men watching sports on tv and shouting all night, and wrecking their room (from what I could see from the open door when I walked by there the next morning). Some of the furniture in my room was broken. The breakfast is not worth mentioning (dry bagels, bad coffee). The lady at reception the next morning was much nicer and helpful.
952	3	This hotel has an exceptional location if you want to be close to the City Center and all the activities there. Our son had an event at the Key Arena. We stayed at the Seattle Pacific Hotel so he could walk to the four day event. Is this place the Ritz No, but it was clean, safe and quiet. The air conditioning worked the shower had good pressure and hot water the television worked fine. The staff was very helpful and friendly. There was a lot of construction going on nearby, but most of the cab drivers knew how to maneuver around it. I would stay there again if this was the area I needed to be.Thanks for your review, and thank you for staying with us! We're looking forward to seeing you again.
953	5	Was looking for a hotel downtown for a concert but due to other activities including the concert all downtown hotels booked up quick. Found this one, reasonably priced. Nice hotel. Very clean and quiet. Short uber ride to downtown.
954	3	Overall stay was satisfactory for quick overnight. Lobby and grounds were attractive and staff were friendly as well as efficient. We experienced no problems except would have liked to swim in the pool. However, a very large school group of young children, apparently on an overnight field trip, had taken over the pool for the evening. Room was a bit... More
955	5	This is a very nice updated hotel. The rooms are very nice. It is close enough to to drive to Hershey but far enough away to not have the crazy Hershey hotel prices. If you are visiting Hershey I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel.
956	3	MoreMore
957	5	We made reservations and stayed here for a weekend with our baseball team. Upon arriving, the friendly staff had our group checked in very quickly. The rooms were quiet, clean, cool, and very comfortable. If you needed something, the staff made sure it was taken care of promptly, great service. They have a nice breakfast with a variety of items... More
958	1	Just not satisfied with the outdated room that had a bad odor, stained mattresses, stained carpet and no hot water in the sink due to faucet being broken. The front desk staff was very pleasant and breakfast was good but that won't bring me back for another stay.
959	5	Having tried to book a room at the W hotel in midtown only to find that it would run close to 500/might, we reserved at the Aloft which sits right next to the site of the new Georgia Dome. The Aloft is very similar to the W, but without some of the frills, which is fine when you save over 200. The rooms were quiet and self parking behind the hotel is secured and only 25, unlike some exorbitant valet fees you can be charged in the ATL. The rooms have complimentary coffee machines included as well as the Bliss bathroom amenities you find in the W. breakfast is self-serve, a-la-carte and offers hot prepared to order sandwiches for 6 - a nice break from the one-price buffet option that many lower cost hotels offer. I hope SPG continues to build these properties as we will seek them out in the future.
960	3	Overall a perfectly adequate hotel. Room was clean, spacious and well appointed. Perfect for a business trip. The elevators require a key-card to get to each floor and this rarely works. In an attempt to be hip cool the hallways are very dark - just creepy not cool.Food options at the hotel are poor. Thank you for your response and letting us know how your recent stay with us was. We are on track to becoming the best hotel we can be and every bit of feedback helps in this journey! We take all responses into account and take note so we can make the necessary changes and adjustments. We hope to see you the next time you are in our great city!
961	5	Best place to stay for market. Hotel is right beside Building 3. You will be glad that you stayed here. We had an issue with our room cleaning which was cleared very fast and professional. The breakfast is good...a little pricey unless you have a meal plan. Thanks for your kind comments about your recent stay with us. Hope to see you return again soon. Safe travels.
962	5	Absolutely no complaints! Room and bathroom were clean and fresh, bed was comfortable, front desk staff was personable and professional, greeting us each time we left or returned. We had a room on the top floor with a view of the river, which made for a very relaxing stay. I cannot think of anything that could have been done better... More

More
964	5	This hotel is very clean and the staff goes out of their way to please you. Rooms are very spacious and there is a kitchen in every room! Great continental breakfast with wonderful selections! This is by far the place to stay when in Sheboygan.
965	5	First time stay but definitely not the last, excellent place to bring in the new year! Our room was spacious, clean and up to date. Staff was very friendly and courteous. Plenty of parking and easy access to the downtown area.
966	4	The hotel is ideally located in the center city area. There are a number of good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. I only stayed one night but if a person has to stay for a few days or a week this is an ideal spot due to the the room layout. The separate kitchen area and bedroom have... More
967	5	Every year our friends and family decent upon this quaint, old style hotel. It's always clean, the rooms are ready upon arrival, water view side is beautiful and Diane is always a phone call away should you need her! Rooms vary from classic 2Q hotel rooms with Coffee maker, fridge and MW to larger suites with a kitchen (cook top... More
968	5	Did an overnight from Tampa and wanted to finally try this place. Very nice views and the room was clean and big(we had a 1BR suite). Nice views of the bay also. Probably only downside is being a good distance from the beach and more of the restaurants but there are shuttles in the area. Overall we really liked it... More
969	3	The motel is well kept. Audrey front desk is very helpful, and nice. She's a real pro. My room was recently updated, and very nice. It was also very clean, and fresh. The AC was a little noisy, but nothing I couldn't live with. If I had to come back this way I'd stay here again. There are a few... More
970	4	Great place to stop in Spring, Summer and Fall have a beer and a steak sandwich on the deck. Most of the help is made of of local high school and college kids, service is usually pretty good.
971	4	Second time staying here for a fishing trip. This time selected a kitchen unit that was well supplied, very clean and comfortable. Can either cook in or eat out. Friendly staff, easy check ins round out a great place to stay.
972	5	The best decision I've made recently, was choosing this great motel in the very pleasant community of Philipsburg. Great host, very friendly and knowledgeable of the immediate area. The price, I think, was to low for a great clean room with all the necessary items you need in a room like micro, refrig, coffee pot and tv with satellite connection.... More
973	5	We stayed two nights here and were very pleansantly surprised that everything written about the hotel is true. It was built in 1912 but remodeled in 1995 with all the modern conveniences yet kept the old, elegant feel of a grand hotel. Room was great, breakfast was amazing, the popcorn and cookies each afternoon were a nice perk. The bed... More
974	4	Good location. Clean, roomy, convenient. Breakfast is coffee and cake. Would stay there again. Reasonable price. Expect a little train noise. After all this is the Hi Line and all the towns are along the train route. Friendly staff.
975	5	The staff and accommodations at the Orlando Airport Hilton Garden Inn are consistently excellent. I have been staying at the hotel for approximately two years on a regular basis and both the pre-arrival and the stay are a positive experience each time I stay the hotel.My staff and I thank you for making the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport hotel your home away from home. As a General Manager I was so delighted to know that we have succeeded in our efforts of providing you with exceptional service, clean and comfortable facilities again and again. This is the best compliment a General Manager can have. I would love the chance to meet you in person when you do return again. Looking forward to welcoming you back soon.Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport
976	5	Nice bed and clean room. Little noisy but its close to airport. Was a short overnight stay but we would stay again. Even used the business. center free kurig coffee in the room. Typical Hilton very nice Bill, thank you for your wonderful feedback regarding your recent stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport, and we are so pleased that you had a great time.

977	5	Stayed one night following a long flight from the UK.Convenient 5/10 mins from the airport. Either a short taxi ride or hotel courtesy bus ride.Clean, large rooms, great nights sleep. Not airport noise.Restaurant was good with variety of food.Breakfast was buffet style but with a great variety of food.Dear Malcolmhh50,Thank you for choosing our hotel for your accommodation needs.

Thanks again for the wonderful feedback and we hope to welcome you again for a longer stay.All the Best,Melissa PetiotAssistant General ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
978	3	Overnight staff not very welcoming, felt like we were bothering him by checking in late. Otherwise, okay accommodations except rooms not very soundproof. Don't plan on sleeping in. Breakfast was very good.Thank you for your review. We want our guests to have a memorable and comfortable experience, so we are sorry to read that we did not fully meet your expectations, and sincerely apologize for your disappointment. We are constantly looking at ways to improve our services and facilities, so we appreciate sharing your constructive feedback with us. On a brighter note, we are glad that you liked the breakfast we served. We hope you will give us another chance to provide you with a much better experience. All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral Manager
979	5	Due to airline difficulties I ended up in Orlando for one night. Room was booked same day. Arrived hungry, frustrated and tired. Check in was friendly and quick. Room was clean. Ate a quick meal at the grill, chef was friendly, food was fresh. Bartender pleasant. Bed comfortable. I always sleep with earplugs so noise wasn't an issue. I did hear planes when I awoke early the next morning. The shuttle driver was a pleasure to speak with on my ride to the airport. Overall I was very pleased. It was a pleasant respite from an otherwise stressful day. We appreciate you taking the time to write a wonderful review about your recent visit to the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. I was sorry to read that your flight was cancelled, as it can be very annoying to find rooms at the last minute and be unsure as to what to expect when you arrive. I am glad that we were able to turn this situation into a pleasant experience. We work hard to keep our facilities clean for our guests and always provide excellent service with a smile. I will share your gracious feedback with my team, especially with my desk team and bartenders. Thanks for being our guest, and we would love to welcome you back, under better circumstances, the next time that you visit Orlando. Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
980	5	For a hotel option near the airport this would be very good selection. Clean room and good service. They offer free shuttle service between the airport and the hotel. For those who like a gym they have one near the lobby. Thank you for the wonderful feedback regarding your stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. We are delighted to read you loved all the aspects of our property, especially our close proximity to the airport. We appreciate you recommending us online and hope to have you back with us soon.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
981	1	So the hotel has a shuttle service from the airport that they told me about when I contacted them earlier in the day. Very pleasant lady I spoke with and extremely helpful. Got off the plane and called to let them know we were here. The driver will be there shortly (remember that phrase, there's a pattern here). Waited 20 minutes and called back same phrase. Did that twice more. The last time I called with attitude she told me the driver had just picked someone up on the A side and after he dropped them off, they would come back for us (the A spots were just across the street). Well, I was none too pleased to put it mildly after waiting that long. Had she been upfront with us, we would have taken a cab the 1 mile or so, which we ended up doing. When we got here to check in, her comment was, instead of I'm sorry for the inconvenience, it was not my problem, they are short a driver tonight. What!!! When I asked to speak to a manager, she said no, there is no manager here and you can deal with me. WHAT!!! It went downhill from there. Can't believe the attitude that was being thrown my way from some twenty year old. Finally just took my keys and left (fortunately I had already checked in online) was a long day. The rooms were adequate although there were mystery smears on the inside of the bathroom door. Went to speak with the front desk this morning but he was again a twenty year old (I guess get done with high school and start working at the hilton). Well, luckily again, I have more Hilton Honors points than I can ever use (and have in the past loved the customer service they provide) at least I didn't have to pay for this experience. There are so many other hotels right here, I suggest avoiding this Hilton at all costs. Looking forward to putting this ordeal behind me and getting on the cruise ship and having the drink of the day.We are very sorry to have provided you with a poor lodging experience and for this, please accept my personal apologies. I am working with my team to address your concerns and you can be assured that corrective actions will be taken to improve our service. Thank you again for your candid review, as we cannot better serve our guests without feedback such as yours. I hope you will give us another chance to accommodate your needs the next time your travels bring you to the area. Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral Manager
982	1	Not much is the answer that I have been repeatedly shown. I requested a feather free room for medical reasons. Checked in at the front desk and the room was being prepared. I asked in person to please have all feathers removed from the room. I have severe allergy to feathers. They said no problem and then put feather pillows on both beds. Inexcusable begavior and a lack of customer service.Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding your stay with us. I am sorry to hear that my associates were not attentive to your needs and overlooked your request. I can assure you that this will be addressed with the proper team members so that this is not repeated again. Thank you again for sharing your observations, and we hope to welcome you back again soon!Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral Manager
983	3	I've stayed here before and overall, they are a great hotel. The shuttle bus came right away, front desk personnel are friendly, and the place is clean and new. However, there was a glitch this time - I called for a 6:30 wake up call and it did not happen. I woke on my own at 6:45 and luckily was not under any time constraints. This could have been a dire situation. I reported this to the front desk and they said they would look into it but I guess they never did because they never got back to me and they never apologized. Also, I do not like the bedcoverings. The duvets are too warm unless you turn the a/c down to a freezing temperature. I kept waking up uncomfortable because I was either too warm (with duvet on) or too cold (with duvet off). Definitely not energy-efficient. The hotel should go back to sheets and a few light blankets.Dear guest Cindy T:I would like to thank you for taking the time to share your experience and disappointment on your last stay. Please accept my apologies the inconvenience that you encountered.We are constantly monitoring the performance of our team member to make sure our valuable guests as yourself is welcome with an efficient and pleasant front desk procedure that provides the accommodations and service you expect. We want our guests to be met with a well-trained staff that puts guest comfort and satisfaction before everything else. I am sorry if this was not your experience. I cannot agree more with you in the matter that it was poorly handle by our associate and I can assure you that this incident will be address to all associates to avoid this for happening again.Hilton Garden Inn is always innovating, testing and looking for ways to ensure that our guest enjoy in every possible way their stay in any of our hotels with a clear consistency. Unfortunately, due to brand standards regulations the current duvets are part of the brand signature. However, if you let us know next time you are here about your preference for a blanket, we can add this to your profile so we can have it ready in your room on your next visit.Once again, please accept my most sincere apologies and I cannot thank you enough for expressing your concerns I hope that you can give us the chance and contact me directly to proof to you how serious we take this issues and how important you are for us. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
984	3	My husband and I stayed here overnight because we had a morning flight and the hotel was very close to the airport in an area with many other well known hotel brands. I had reserved online and from the pictures it looked like a nice hotel, not luxurious but certainly more than acceptable. As soon as we drove up we saw that the lobby area was sealed off and that the registration area was moved into the dining room. We walked in and the staff was very friendly but they had done nothing to make their new registration area appealing. It was set up on a long work table that was very cluttered. We got our room and when we parked around the back and walked in the main floor was very seedy looking. The carpet was worn out and everything looked used and dingy. Once we got to our room though on the second floor it looked as if the carpet on that floor had been replaced. The furnishings in the room and the linens looked very nice and there was an updated coffee maker and a big desk area. The bathroom though looked old and the fixtures definitely needed an update. There were so many other hotels in that location to choose from so I would not plan on staying there again.Dear guest neisie13:I would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to write about your experience during your stay at the Hilton Garden inn Orlando Airport.We want our guests to have the best experience possible where everything is in place, of the highest quality, and in perfect working order. I am sorry if that was not the case during your stay. Unfortunately there is never a good time to start a renovation in a hotel. For the past year we have been doing our renovation in phases so we can avoid as much as possible to inconvenience our guests and their experience last October we finished all our guestrooms and hallways, except for the hallway on the first floor because taking in consideration our current lobby renovation we didnt want the new carpet to be damage so carpet on the first floor will be the last item to go in.Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport values your patronage we want you as our loyal guest! Again, please accept my most sincere apologies, and hope you will allow us the opportunity to serve you again in the future and shows you the improvements in our product for your enjoyment. Sincerely, Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
985	5	Stopped overnight here for our visit to Orlando and not disappointed at all. I am convinced the staff could have there worst day ever and still be smiling their aptitude is so positive you can feel the energy.Even the guy that mops the floor greets you with a smile and a good morning. the rooms are ultra clean as well as all the hotel. the hotel also boasts a bar grill and the service and food are fantastic. I have stayed at a lot of hotels and this one by far is 5 star.It was our pleasure to host you at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport, and thank you for sharing your feedback. I am so pleased that you felt we were successful in meeting your needs and expectations in regard to your spotless room and our excellent service. We look forward to the opportunity of welcoming you back soon!Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
986	4	This is a typical Hilton Garden Inn with room setups the same as all of this brand across the country. On site restaurant for dinner and breakfast with good food at a fair price.PROS:Close to the airport, but not noisyVery very cleanComfy Sleep Number beds with comfortable linensDecent pillowsBathroom lighting is goodPlenty of hot water with good water pressureIn room fridge, coffee maker, etc.Very good customer service attentive and polite.Free wifiShuttle to the airport took about ten minutesCONS:None that I can really think of! Got a decent rate that included breakfast, shuttle was on time, staff was great. No reason to avoid this hotel. If you need to be close to the airport at a good price with a clean, comfortable place to stay, this is a fine choice.Good Day TravelMommy1,On behalf of the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport team, thank you for sharing your wonderful comments regarding our performance and experience during your stay.

987	5	We spent 3 nights at the Hilton Garden Inn. The staff was very helpful as we need to have foam pillows and not feather pillows. The staff immediately made the change to help prevent any more allergic reactions. We also had one experience with a small spot of blood on one sheet. The staff came up immediately, changed the bedding and then gave us a voucher for free breakfast.Thank you for your recent stay at the Hilton Garden Orlando Airport and for sharing your feedback with us. We appreciate you recognizing and commending our staff for providing you with excellent customer service. However, we are sorry for the housekeeping issues you encountered. Nonetheless, we are glad that we were able to resolve the issue immediately to your satisfaction. It was our pleasure to host you and we hope to see you again soon.All the Best, Debra Thompson-French General Manager Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
988	5	This HGI is typical of the brand. However, the staff stood out as really friendly and helpful during my stay. I would recommend this hotel if you need to stay near the Orlando airport. The shuttle is convenient and reliable, the restaurant is nice, and the rooms are clean and crisp. There are restaurants within walking distance if you want to get out, and a sports bar behind the hotel if you want to have a few drinks without taking a cab or designating a driver. Good spot and experience.Thank you for the wonderful feedback regarding your stay with us at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. We are glad to know that you enjoyed staying with us and that you loved our courteous staff, immaculate accommodations, as well as our restaurant. We are also happy to know that you liked our convenient location and the scheduled shuttle service we provided. We appreciate you recommending us and do hope to host you again in the future.All the Best,Charles StephensAssistant General ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport

Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport
990	2	The Hilton Garden Inn at the Orlando airport is conveniently located. That is the only good thing I can say about it. While the room was ok, for the price I would have expected something much better. The restaurant was a joke with terrible atmosphere, slow service and extremely poor quality food.Dear guest Mark E, I really appreciate your taking the time to share your recent experience. I want to personally apologize for your inconvenience with our restaurant. We want our guests to have the best experience possible where everything exceeds their expectations. I am sorry if that was not the case during your visit. We value you as a guest, and I do want you to know that your concerns are our concerns! Should you have any question please do not hesitate to contact us at the hotel.Sincerely, Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
991	5	I stayed in room 336 for the weekend. Nice quiet room away from elevators ice machines. Since it's near the end of the hall, not much walk by traffic either. Besides the usual guest room door closing I didn't notice any noise from either side. As a woman traveling alone I felt completely safe at the Hilton. The fire pits were fun at night, the bartender was really nice along with the rest of the staff it made for a relaxing stay. I would also like to thank the Hilton for providing a dedicated, well lite smoking area for those of us who still do. Thanks Hilton!Please accept my appreciation for your wonderful feedback regarding your recent stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. I am so pleased that you felt we were successful in meeting your needs and expectations.

The hotel is clean has fresh coffee, water and hot cookies which is always a treat, great staff as well...It is so nice to hear that your stay with us was enjoyable on every front. We were glad to know that you were satisfied with the services, staff, accommodations, and amenities we offered you during your stay. Our guests frequently mention how conveniently close we are to the airport and the various eateries in our surrounding location. Im glad you felt the same. Thank you for choosing the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport hotel for your stay and we hope to welcome you back once again. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
993	5	I didn't think I would like this hotel but on the contrary I loved it! The hotel is centrally located on Semoran Blvd about 10 minutes from Orlando airport.First, we were warmly greeted and asked if we were Hilton members which was nice. I must add, the decor was very welcoming!Up the elevator and into our room - very nice. Comfortable, king size, cozy bed. The first thing I did was to jump on the bed and roll from side to side. The amenities in the room was nice, TV, soap, shampoo, etc. Sitting area and free wifi in the room and free on-site parking were welcome additions. The location of the hotel gave you many opportunities for restaurants and shopping -- so many choices your head will spin. The good addition was buffet breakfast with freshly made waffles -- my favorite! I was in waffle heaven!We drove to a nearby mall which was nice - I don't recall the name but it was easy getting there. We rented a car from Dollar Car Rental in the airport. I would never rent from Dollar at the Orlando Airport again - I was on line for 1 hour. Awful! Overall it was a great hotel and will be added to my favorites list!Dear Guest talyah, I would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to write about your experience during your stay at the Hilton Garden inn Orlando Airport.

994	5	I highly recommend this hotel. I found the staff helpful and caring...even in the flurry of morning rush, they noticed that I was not feeling well and asked if there was anything they could do. In the 'by the book numbers' process of today, this act of kindness was very touching. They all went out of the way to correct every little thing.I thank you for appreciating my staffs caring and helpful deeds in your review. I am glad they went above and beyond to help you out with your issue. I was also happy to know that they left a good impression on you which resulted in you recognizing their service and sharing it with our online viewers. I am sure they will be very delighted once they read your review. We are grateful to you for recommending us to our online viewers. Thank you for choosing us and we would love to have another opportunity of welcoming you back to our hotel again.Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
995	1	This has been a horrible experience. I was on vacation with my husband and son and this pretty much ruined some of it. At check-in, they had to cancel my existing reservation and start two new ones because my stay was supposed to be paid for with my points (points for 2 nights and pay for 1 night). I would have to check in again after my first two nights and get my key cards reprogrammed. A hassle, but I was willing to do it. They had already put a hold on by debit card for 415.74. They advised us that the hold would be released as per the manager and the money would be credited back. The hold was not released as promised and I had to spend at least an hour at the front desk the next morning trying to get it handled. I also had to call my bank and let the front desk person talk to them in order to get the release done. Our bank took the hold off of the card once they were given an authorization number. I woke up the next morning and found that this hotel had run my debit card for the 415.74 AGAIN. This transaction overdrafted my bank account. I am not even sure yet if the bank is going to charge me an overdraft fee for the hotel's mistake. It was a good thing that I had more money that I could transfer to that account or we would've had issues going to the theme parks or eating meals. My husband went down to the front desk again and had to go through the same hour long session trying to get the problem taken care of. BOTH days of this, we were late getting to the theme parks that our child had been looking forward to. They credited the card back via the bank again. The front desk said that the release of the funds from the day before has never been released as promised. We were assured by front desk personnel that the manager would be in later and that they would have him call us. He did not call us. My husband called the front desk around 5:00 that evening and we were told that the manager said he wouldn't be able to look into anything until the next day. We were flying out the next day. This stay has been the worst I have ever experienced. Very disappointed. We used Hilton Garden Inn because if their good reputation on our last two trips and have spent thousands of dollars staying with them over the last six weeks. We feel that the fact that none of the management had time for us is inexcusable and terrible customer service. We will not do it again.Thank you for sharing your experience about your stay with us. Please accept my personal apologies for the inconvenience that you have experienced during your arrival and the remainder of your stay. I certainly understand and appreciate the time you took to sharing your concerns. I have discussed your review with my Front Office staff to see where we went wrong, and to come-up with actionable strategies so that this does not happen again. We would really appreciate you giving us another opportunity to prove ourselves the next time you are in the area. We hope to see you again soon.All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral Manager
996	3	Had trouble with flights so had to stay here for one night unexpectedly. It is a weird property for a Hilton, and doesn't feel upscale at all. My room was fine and unusually large. The bed was comfortable, I had hot water and decent water pressure. I didn't do any heavy lifting with the wifi but it was solid for me. The airport shuttle was quick and easy. They had a (paid) breakfast but I didn't partake. The best part was the staff at the front desk, they must have stolen them from Disney, as they were exceptionally friendly and helpful. No real complaints, but they charged me more than my Disney hotel did, for far less value, and that just left a bad taste in my mouth. If the price had been lower, I would've rated this higher.Robb H, thank you for your review. Your total satisfaction is always our top priority, so we are sorry there were few issues which kept you from giving us a higher rating. Your feedback is appreciated and we hope to welcome you back again. Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral Manager
997	5	This location is a mile from the airport. However it was very quiet,and we could walk to the restaurant next door. Well staffed with helpful and friendly staff, and very clean. Good amenities including towel bin at outdoor pool. Will stay there again.Please accept my appreciation for your wonderful feedback regarding your stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. We are so pleased to read that you loved our convenient location, friendly associates and our well-kept amenities. It was great to have you here, and we look forward to your next stay with us soon.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
998	4	the Hilton Garden at Orlando airport lives up to the Hilton standards. The hotel staff is warm and welcoming. The rooms comfortable and quiet. Acces to the airport is less than 2 miles and there was no airport noise detected in the rooms. Not a common experience when staying near an airport.Dear Guest minneapolispat, I would like to thank you on behalf of my team for your kind comments on our performance and your experience on your stay.

1000	5	We stayed a single night after driving back from Key West the staff were all really helpful food was excellent at dinner and breakfast look forward to staying there again next year. We would recommend to any oneWe appreciate you staying at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport recently and for recommending us.

All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1001	5	Clean rooms and very nice staff. Would stay here again. The pool was well kept and I appreciated that I had free wifi and was able to use the business centre including printing my boarding passes and they did not charge me for this service.Dear Guest Victoria E, I would like to thank you for sharing your experience at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport during your stay. Nowadays with so many choices in life specially when travelling with hotels, airlines, places, restaurants, etc one of the most rewarding aspects of our job is to know that we were able to make a difference and exceeded our guests expectations. Thank you for staying with us and we are looking forward to welcome you to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
1002	2	I picked this location because it was close to MCO, relatively affordable, and had a free airport shuttle. The room was ok, though is showing wear (for example, bathroom tiles were cracked and some grout was missing). The linens were very cheap and coarse (I quite literally got rug burn on my elbow from rolling over in the night). The shuttle to the airport in the morning was fine, but I couldn't get the front desk to stay on the line long enough to get picked up from the airport after returning my rental car (seriously irritating when someone answers the phone and immediately puts you on hold before taking 30 seconds or less to understand the reason for the call). I spent about 10 minutes on hold (despite trying to call 3 different times) and eventually took a cab to the hotel (which annoyed the cabbie greatly since it was a short fare).Given this experience, I wouldn't recommend staying here unless it's the cheapest cost. It was reasonably quiet and I slept ok all things considered, but there are several options in the immediate vicinity.Dear Falconsview, thank you for sharing your experience and for being our guest. While overall you had a pleasant stay, we are unhappy with the lack of service received from our front desk staff. Please accept our apologies for any inconveniences that you experienced being put on hold for so long. We have discussed your comments with our staff to make sure each guest is greeted promptly and no requests are ignore. We would really appreciate you giving us another opportunity to prove ourselves the next time you are in the area. We hope to see you again soon.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral Manager
1003	4	The Fairfield is a value-budget hotel. Amenities were fine and commensurate with price. Complementary breakfast was good. Bed a little too soft but otherwise very good. Service friendly and helpful. Restaurants nearby. It is very convenient to I 81
1004	4	Hotel staff was very friendly! Room was clean and the bathroom was large and clean. Breakfast was very nice... hot and plentiful. The hotel is in an area not far from many stores, mall, big-box retail places... too far to walk but within 5 minute drive. While there we took a nice trip to Nay Aug Park. Overall, this was... More
1005	5	my family and I stayed here for six days. We had six adults and one infant at different times thru out our stay. I can not say enough of the kindness and attentiveness of the entire staff of this hotel. Just passing an employee in the hall, we were greeted and asked if there was anything we needed. The breakfast... More
1006	5	I frequently have to travel to Parkersburg for business and always look forward to staying at the Blennerhassett. The staff is always very friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The building is also very beautiful. But my favorite part is Spats Restaurant located in the hotel. They frequently have live music and always serve complimentary appetizers... More
1007	5	We had my sisters baby shower in their air conditioned outside tent and it was so nice. It was the perfect size for 30-50 people and it was nice and cool and the lights were very charming. We were treated so nice from the staff and they were very accommodating. Thank you for a nice day!
1008	1	Staff members repeatedly entered my moms room late at night (there was no door latch) without her permission and invaded her privacy. The building manager was apologetic and offered a 15 discount. My mom was assured that senior management would contact her, and no one has. My room smelled of mildew and the bathroom was dingy. The shower dropped all night and kept me awake.
1009	2	I was really looking forward to this hotel. The website made it look pretty cute. I did read the reviews but generally take reviews with a grain of salt do to disgruntled people leaving the majority of them. however I became part of the disgruntled group. there was no cleaning service while we were in the hotel room. We had to ask for new linens and new towels and only received new towels. The Linens had a distinct bleach stain on them that we could identify that they had never been changed. The linens are not fitted sheets they were just tucked in top sheets so by the end of the night we were looking at the disgusting mattress. it's a shame cuz if this hotel was managed properly it would be a gem. located in a prime spot on st-charles right next to a trolley stop and in a very cute historic building. unfortunately the cleanliness or lack thereof was a major turnoff. I specifically chose this hotel because it looked like a mom and pop but quickly learned my lesson. I will be visiting and specifically staying in a corporate Hotel upon our next trip to New Orleans because I know a corporate Hotel will have quality standards. I was overall very disappointed.
1010	5	It is a decent motel in a very expensive location, the prices might go up on the weekdays but still end up getting a pretty nice deal. The manager is very welcoming and friendly staff. Will come back in near future.
1011	3	This hotel has a good location if you want to walk around the area and the price when I booked was okay. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:Breakfast was good for the price and they were able to make a few adjustments for me which was appreciated. Wifi was strong and easy to connect to - not free though. Location was good for walking around the areaCons:The staff was obviously just there to collect a pay check and really didn't seem that happy about itThey charge you a fee when you check in that you have to accept that includes access to a paper, wifi, and some other basic things. It was 21 and stating the hotel has free wifi but then making you pay a fee to cover it is not transparent.The room was in pretty poor shape, paint was chipped in the door frames and tiles/sink were cracked in the bathroom. I know the hotel is old, but it felt neglected.
1012	4	Overall I am satisfied with my 2 days stay at Hotel Rex. The location is perfect: close to everything at Union Square, China Town, etc. The lobby looks very nice. The room was reasonably clean. Given the location, the room was not too small. The stay was pleasant except the occasional noise during the day and sometimes during the night (we stayed a street-facing room at the third floor). The service was excellent. We arrived at noon, but was able to check in without any problem.
1013	5	This is my first trip to San Francisco and therefore my first - but not last- say at the Rex, I'm back here is 4 days.This hotel was recommended to me by friends and they were spot on. I arrived here mid morning after a long flight from Australia and the wonderful desk staff let me into my room early, a quiet one at the back and very comfortable, room 404. They also helped me arrange some activities.I love wine hour at the bar, a free glass of wine, a chat to the barman and a read and relax. It's been a great way to unwind each afternoon.Good bed, great pillows, clean and with character. I'm looking forward to being back on Thursday.Thanks so much for the great review. Please let me know when you return to the Rex and we will make sure you are well taken care of!-Ina
1014	5	We live in San Francisco and had the pleasure of staying here for 2 nights just to act like tourists. Room was great and very clean. Bar scene is fun. All personnel were excellent. Close to Union Square so walking distance of city center.
1015	4	I try to stay at Rex Hotel whenever I am in San Francisco for business, which is every few months. The hotel definitely has character. The location is hard to beat as well. Since San Francisco is not densely populated, I recommend staying in Union Square area since it is always lively even late in the evening. On the other hand hotels towards Tenderloin area would not be a good choice if you like to take a walk around. Rex Hotel is on Sutter Street which is close enough to Union Square but far enough from Tenderloin.I like to order breakfast in my room. It also serves as a wake up call. Wireless internet in the room works decent enough. Did not slow down during the evening where many people connect to it.I only stayed as single person in their room. For a couple maybe ask for a large room as their rooms are not very big.
1016	4	Staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is a little tired but clean.I had a single room and would approx the size as 7ft by 15ft (hotel site may confirm). The view was to the apartments opposite and an alleyway below. I took earplugs as Ive been to NYC before and its noisy. The room had a singe bed, wardrobe, desk and mounted tv. Also had an ensuite. Rooms a little tired but again - clean. The toiletries were of a good standard which was a nice surprise.No breakfast facilities in the hotel - coffee and tea is available to take out in the mornings from a trolley in reception. The best thing about this hotel is its location. 5 mins from Broadway (Times Sq) - cant fault it.I will be back!!Dear Shy,Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay. There is no one better to judge our performance than you, our guest. We have made great efforts to create an environment of comfort for our guests. May I recommend a larger room category for your future reservation I do believe you will be satisfied. On behalf of the hotels management team we thank you for your patronage and we look forward to welcoming you back to the Washington Jefferson Hotel.Sincerely yours,Management WJ Hotel
1017	5	My family and I just returned from staying at the Oak Island Inn. We unfortunately, had to come down for a memorial service for a family member. On short notice I had to make arrangements for myself, my mom and my children. I came across the Oak Island Inn and based on the reviews decided to make a reservation. I... More
1018	5	My mother, nephew,niece, and myself stayed at the Sleep Inn , and we so enjoyed it. The room was clean and had everything that we needed for the night. The location is wonderfully close to the interstate, restaurants, and some shopping. What made the stay even more pleasurable was the staff. Stefani was the best she made our stay there... More
1019	2	Room appeared to have new mattresses which was good to see because I was a little skeptical after the looks of the rest of the hotel. Now they need to spend money on new pillows. The one I had was very lumpy therefore I did not sleep well. New towels would also be a nice touch. Didn't have time to... More
1020	5	The room was one of the largest I hve stayed in that was not a suite. Beds were comfortable, furnishings were tastful. Free internet. All the ladies at the front desk were helpful, knowledgable and friendly. Great value too.
1021	5	Spent a week at the Pearl, Rowena and of course Harry were special. We tried every day for a week to Stump Harry with our questions. Never did. Facility was top notch, service too.
1022	4	Whenever we can I elect to stay in a Holiday Inn, I feel safe and secure there. Inn's are well lit, clean, staff very professional. Easy check in, easy check out. Clean rooms, sheets, pillowcases. We steal the toiletries and send to the troops overseas, via Operation Shoebox. The Inn staff is scratching their heads, I know. LOL Regardless outstanding... More
1023	5	Very nice and clean room, great hot breakfast, reasonable price, across the highway from a large casino with a shuttle bus.. Staff are helpful and friendly.TV had LOTS of channels to chose from. Easy access, right off of I-44. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from, I saw a large playground behind the hotel, being enjoyed by several kids.
1024	5	This Comfort Suites hotel exceeded my every expectation. The staff was friendly and curteous plus the rooms were well maintained and clean. This location is extremely accomodating to the guests, with hot coffee and warm cookies available through the day, and they make every effort to serve the Lawton/Fort Sill community.
1025	4	Located just off I-95 at Walterboro, SC. Very friendly staff, decent breakfast (bread products), clean rooms and large parking lot. Good stop before heading South to Daytona! The beds are soft, not firm and the TV is a crystal clear flat screen.
1026	5	Having traveled more than 42 states and therefore... many hotels over the years including even having a 'Business Class' in BC's renowned Empress Hotel years back... And I can attest to the fact that I never felt more cared about and never have received such personable and excellent TLC anywhere - Ever! They have a staff that is extraordinary in... More
1027	5	We booked this hotel minutes before arriving and were beyond pleased. My son raved how it was the nicest hotel he's stayed at and he's traveled a lot. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The pool felt very warm and perfect! The staff was very kind and accommodating. The restaurant had a very yummy breakfast buffet for a good... More
1028	5	Came here for a one-night stay from Chicago, I had a co ple meetings in the area. Requested a King size bed when I made my reservation. When I went to the front desk they told me all the rooms with King beds were taken. So they put me in the family suite instead! It had a room with the... More
1029	5	This is the first time we've stayed at the Best Western in Kearney, NE. (4/17/2016). It was very easy to find (right off the freeway). The young man who checked us in was very proficient at his job as well as friendly and polite. We loved the room we were assigned. The location was excellent and It was very clean... More
1030	5	We spent a night here on a cross country trip and it was a very nice Best Western. We didn't arrive until almost 10 PM and it was easy check in and we were asked if we wanted a room on the 1st or second floor. We were driving a U-Haul and pulling a trailer so it was nice to... More
1031	5	We found this hotel to be clean, friendly, comfortable and an excellent place to stay while in Kearney to see the Sandhill Crane migration. Close to the Platt River and a convenient drive to Fort Kearney State Rec Area, the Ian Nicolson Audubon Center and the corn fields where the Cranes congregate. On the outskirts of town but still convenient... More
1032	5	We stayed in Cabin 8....we totally enjoyed it. The cabin is old but it fits with the surroundings. I'm 54 and it reminds me of cabins I stayed in as a child. So if you want cute and cozy this is the place to stay. Owners/Hostess of cabins were very friendly and helpful.
1033	4	Stayed here for a quick weekend get away while attending a Cardinals game. Overall I thought the hotel was nice. Very nice helpful staff, nice clean comfortable room. The morning breakfast buffet was pretty decent! This hotel is very close to the airport, and the airport shuttle will take you and pick you up free of charge. At least they... More
1034	4	Wish I could rate it at 4.5. This was a clean, quiet, comfortable hotel. The price was what one can expect given the area in the middle of the summer. We were actually right next to the fitness room and close to the lobby but we were never disturbed. It is a short drive to the beach so the savings... More
1035	3	We often stay in Holiday In Express when we travel. This one was pretty standard. The hotel is a little worn and could use some sprucing up, but our room was fine. The front desk clerk was cordial, even when handling an obnoxious person who was making a scene. There's a nice little pool and hot tub. The breakfast was... More
1036	5	My family and I stay here frequently. Awesome place in every season! Quiet, family oriented. Great gift shop! Unique rooms. Amazing customer service. And a pony in the parking lot at bike rentals. Very close to beach.Thank you for the awesome review! We appreciate your business and hope to see you again soon.
1037	1	The worse motel stay. I will never stay here again. Corrosion on the faucets. They stressed no smoking in the rooms and have you sign acknowledgement. However, when i entered my room the smell of cigarettes met me at the door. After I complained they sprayed a deodorizer. Let me say cigarettes and deodorizer cover don't smell good. I then... More
1038	4	The location is fabulous if you want to be in the French Quarter. Rooms are a little dated, but nice, still quiet even though it's one block off Bourbon street, and the Bombay Club bar/restaurant was great. I would come back and would recommend. I would say this is an epitomy of a New Orleans old charm hotel.Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your stay! We work hard to meet expectations and were happy that we hit the mark. We hope to have the pleasure of hosting you again during your next visit to New Orleans!
1039	5	Traveling on I-80 we found Countryside . . and glad we did! Clean large rooms, comfy beds and pillows. Quiet too! Great location if you are just passing through. Gas station and a few restaurants close by. Staff was very friendly, I strongly disagree with any of the negative reviews that have been left.
1040	2	So, this hotel reminded me of a motel 6. Rooms were outdated. We stayed on the first floor and had to enter our room from the outside. Room was musty smelling. The shower's hot water, turned up all the way was not hot. The complimentary breakfast area had a bathroom (unisex) that workers were using while we were trying to... More
1041	3	I feel *so* guilty giving this place a ho-hum review. Thats because the couple that runs the place are *so* nice! Gia, the GM, is always available, helping at every turn. And thats the problem--you *will* need help at every turn. THINGS THAT BUGGED ME: no individual room temperature control, no inside door latch, dust balls, cobwebs, crumbling window sills,... More
1042	2	I don't mind old hotels as they can have a quaint charm about them. But the Bertram is in dire need of some TLC. When checking in (I was here for a wedding), the staff failed to provide me the gift that the bride had prepared for her guests. The desk staff was pleasant but moved on to the next... More
1043	5	Bed was super comfortable. Water pressure excellent. Service was stupendous. Food was great. Room was clean, I have a phobia and checked everything, everywhere for nasty and non was to be found. Overall a very pleasant experience. Would definitely stay here again.
1044	4	We had a very pleasant stay. After reading some reviews I was concerned, but the room was nice, clean and odorless :) The staff was exceptionally pleasant. We played the slot on premise and actually won. The Inn is about a mile or so away from Turning Stone,
1045	2	Don't expect alot from this property! Room's are not kept up, hole in bathroom door, security latch on main door missing, carpet needs cleaning or replacement. As with many chain hotels, there is an entry door that you use your room key to open, however...MoreDear Carol, We apologize for not meeting your expectations and appreciate the feedback. We have shared your concerns with Breakfast attendant to ensure this doesn't occur again. We hope to have another opportunity to welcome you back. Regards, Management
1046	3	when you first see hotel, it looks very nice from the outside with the exception of the roof. you walk inside and it looks very cultured. But as you look deeper, you see a property that is badly in need of repair and a really good cleaning. the room we had was clean at least. there were a few holes... More
1047	5	Spent four nights and enjoyed it a lot! I wouldn't mind going back, but I'd probably try somewhere else on my next visit to NYC, just to be fun. Some notes:- No digital clocks in the room... nice analog clocks for a change! - Workout facility in-house, reasonably good enough and clean. No pool onsite, but access is given to a nearby gym at reasonable rates apparently. - Small but beautiful elevators- Only hotel that I have been to that has Opus One and Johnny Blue bottles available for purchase in each room. - We had free wi-wi in room- We had Club access and that is our favorite way to go at the Ritz. Some pros and cons include: * Lots of food and coffee when needed * Some flies on cheese * Helpful and nice people / service * Great breakfast * Repeated menu EVERY single day... a bit boring. - Got free parking with one of my rooms, but not the other. Would have been 65/day (!) - Nice amount of pens, paper, soaps, and other useful items in room including currency power converter for international devices- Choice of AM newspapers- Extremely fair at checkout... anything we didn't agree with was immediately taken off our bill. Cons:- Horses hang out across the street and often lobby has horse-smell. - Cigarette smell in EACH of three hotel rooms that I was in during my stay. After about 5 minutes in the room you wont notice it any more. - Very few, if any, rooms with two beds in them... - The employee's two way radios do not work in every room, causing delays- In room safe is too small for laptop- Welcome water was offered by front desk, but could have been helpful in the room instead. - Requested to see if an upgrade was available at checkin -- maybe, but only for additional money. - Do not even think of getting a room not facing central park in this hotel. Not only does it not face central park, it faces NOTHING. We moved out of this smelly room immediately. - Draws are small in room- Only one luggage rack in our room- Relatively small rooms to other Ritz properties I've been to
1048	5	Located to the South of Central Park the hotel is in a convenient, very animated and touristic location. A few minutes from 5th avenue and the hype upper east side, a lot can be done walking. The view over Central Park is priceless and above all, service and attention to details are of high standing. Classic decoration. We've had room service and Stratos made sure we spent a lovely in room dinner. Many stars come to this hotel, i must admit though we've seen none.
1049	5	My wife and I travelled to NYC to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and we booked into The Ritz Carlton. From the moment the doorman opened our car door and welcomed us to our departure nothing was too much for this hotel and its amazing staff. Everyone was intent on making our stay the best it could possibly be. A nice touch, on checking in I let slip it was our anniversary when we were handed our complimentary cocktail cards (v nice touch) to welcome us. The extremely personable reception lady (from Czech Republic) must have made a mental note, because on the evening of our anniversary we were sent champagne and chocolates.The Ritz Carlton is a super luxurious hotel but at a human scale and we could find no fault at all during our stay. It was amazing to go to sleep and wake overlooking Central Park.Thanks everyone! We will be back!
1050	5	The staff and hotel first class. We made the mistake of eating in the hotel restaurant. Should have known better as the restaurant was empty on a Saturday night. My fish was half cook and half raw. It was returned and was not charge ,but it destroy the family meal.
1051	5	clean, great staff, warm welcome! Front desk lady was great when we came in. Super helpful to our needs as we had a newborn baby. All the staff seemed to have a smile on. Perfect spot to stay! Thank you
1052	5	We stayed at the Best Western Plus on our way to Maryland. We stopped here because of our great experience with the Great Western Sweetgrass in Charleston and we are happy we did. This is a lovely quiet hotel. The rooms are very comfortable, the check in is efficient and the service is great. In addition they welcomed our Golden... More
1053	5	They aim to please at this Hampton and go above and beyond for everything. Hotel is clean, well furnished with local history and character, and a most accommodating staff, especially Mr. Mike. Probably the best hotel in the Wilkesboro area.
1054	5	For years we've been talking about a visit to Cooperstown and we were extremely pleased with our choice of the Rose Thistle. Patti was very welcoming as we arrived and spot on with the directions she gave us around town and further as well as in her recommendations. The B B is located right on the trolley route... More
1055	5	Although they are under construction they did everything they could to accommodate us. The staff was truly some of the friendliest we've experienced. There was 9 adults in our party and they let us bring our own beversges and snacks down to the dining area in the late evening. Make sure to bring tip money down to breakfast!
1056	4	Enjoyed my stay last week at the Hampton. Near the Crabtree Mall with nice restaurants and stores. Good for a business visit. Typical Hampton rooms and benefits. I would stay again here if I came back to town on business. Was able to get a...More
1057	4	Second stay here, other was 2 years ago. Centrally located, lots of retail near by, every thing you could want. Right off 440 , but in a quiet area. In fact is a *very* quiet hotel. Airport a short drive away. Traffic pattern for the...More
1058	5	We have stayed here many times and it's always a comfortable relaxing experience. Ted and Sallie share their beautiful craftsman home and in the morning serve a delicious breakfast in the dining room. Gingerbread pancakes with maple cream topping is a good way to start the day. Briar Rose is an easy walk to town and a block away from... More
1059	4	Stayed here for one night Nov 2017 after visiting Joshua Tree National Park. The motel is about a 10 minute drive to the Joshua Tree visitor centre, whilst a 10 minute drive in the opposite direction will take you to Yucca Valley where there are...More
1060	5	All BW Staff, front desk (Lisa) and manager(lyn) are very professionnal and take good care of my group (50 people). Very convenient because this hotel is in Chinatown NY, around cheap chinese restaurant and food market. Our group are very happy to stay in this hotel with comfortable bed and various delicious breakfast. I will stay defintely in this hotel for my next trip with another group. no regret.
1061	1	Chose this location because of event attending. Had good experiences with Hampton in the past at other locations. This was not a good experience. No hot water, boiled eggs tasted like onions. Staff polite and very nice. Compensated for no hot water in rate reduction. Not worth the higher price rate for a night's stay.
1062	2	I am sure at some point this was a grand hotel but those days are long gone. They are doing a massive renovation inside and out but how they are doing it makes for a terrible room experience. They are going to expand the rooms by 3 feet out to the outer ledge of the outside of the building out... More
1063	4	The staff is very friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean, there are several restaurants within easy walking and driving. If you find yourself in Gadsden, Al this is a good hotel to try. They even have a free breakfast and wifi, for a pretty good price.
1064	5	Like most Hampton Inns, this was a clean, well kept property. The staff was very helpful and considerate. A lot of the Hampton Inns will give you free water when you ask. this hotel was no exception. They offered me water and gave me as much as I wanted. The Internet was fast and reliable, which is another major thing... More
1065	4	Excellent bargain for overnight stay within walking distance to the American Airlines Center where we saw Ed Sheeran. Really helps the overall experience and they include a shuttle to and from the concert.Thanks for the feedback!
1066	3	Excellent location and value for price. But lobby is a bit shabby, smelly, and beds lumpy and hammock-like. I expected more comfortable beds as I've stayed at other similar hotels like this and beds were definitely more comfortable. The hotel has a convenient shuttle to go to nearby places and the location is excellent.
1067	5	I went for a girls weekend to watch a football game and didn't know what to expect. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. We were impressed by the size of the rooms they were decently sized and having a mini kitchen really is useful. The complementary breakfast in the morning is a really big added bonus. It is within walking distance to everything and we definitely recommend this hotel.
1068	5	I recently stayed at the Sheraton for about four days to enjoy the parks and Orlando. I have to say my stay was perfect. Eimy was just wonderful, she printed out all the directions for me and my family and answered all my questions. Every time I needed something she was right there to help. Eimy was truly the face of The Sheraton during my stay!! :)
1069	5	We stayed one night after a cruise. The hotel is spotless. There were 2 huge rooms in the suite. The living room had a massive flat screen tv's. The bedroom had a nice 32 We were picked up and returned your the airport by the shuttle and both drivers were amazing.We arrived at 11 am and they rushed to get our room ready. What a great place to relax before our flight home.There is a fridge,microwave and coffee maker in the room. There is also a free bottle of water which I thought was a nice touch. The staff at the front desk were extremely polite and appeared to be well trained.Nice lobby and restaurant/bar. The pool is an indoor/outdoor type and was beautifully heated. Will definitely return.Thank you for taking the time to post such a detailed and wonderful review - we greatly value your feedback and your business. It was a pleasure to make a relaxing day possible with an early check in. Our team members pride themselves in providing first class service and it is very rewarding to read comments like yours. Thank you again for sharing your thoughts and I look forward to having you as our guest again soon
1070	4	We stayed there overnight between flights from Jamaica to Salt Lake City. The only bad thing about our stay is we got in at midnight and left the following morning, we did not get a chance to enjoy the room. Service was excellent, from pick up at airport, front desk, and shuttle back to airport. Our room was a two room suite with a Tv in the bedroom and a flat screen Hidef in the living room. Nice size refrigorator and micro wave. Since we got in so late , we did not take advantage of them. Would stay again for a longer period of time. Wi-fi was at an extra cost in the room, but the computer in the lobby allowed us internet to print our boarding passes.
1071	3	I stayed here on night prior to returning home. The hotel is in a great location near the airport and expressway. You are about 20 minutes from Universal studios and Walt Disney World. There are restaurants in the area.The front desk clerks and van shuttle drivers on both the evening and graveshift very nice.The lobby area is nice with free wifi in this area. However the hallways,elevators and rooms need updating.The hallways are very dark and on the third floor, several stains on the ceiling.The rooms are very large with plenty of space. Large work desk area. The wetbar has a coffee maker with Starbuck products. Also a microwave and mini frig.The living area has sofa and chair and flat screen tv. However while the room was clean, was very dated.The bed was very comfy with four large pillows. Also a flat screen tv in room (great if traveling with others.). The vanity area is in the bedroom with carpet. The closet has mirrors on the outside.The toilet area is small,but nice. Plenty of towels and heating light.The elevators are old and loud.The biggest peeve was with the ice situation. Signage in the elevator stated ice machines on second and first floor. Went to the one on the second floor, out of order. Walked down to the first floor, this ice machine is out of order. The one on the first floor stated, use the one on the third floor in the laundry area. Headed back to the third floor. The ice machine is in the laundry area in an odd position. The other peeve is internet charge in the room and not the lobby.I would only stay here again if the hotel update the hallways and rooms are updatedDear Airlink99Thank you for your recent visit to the Sheraton Suites Orlando Airport and for taking the opportunity to provide our company with the gift of feedback. Your comments have been shared with our team and the ice machines have been replaced. Our lobby and fitness center were renovated 2 years ago and our ownership is making arrangements to do a complete hallways and guest rooms renovation in the up coming months. Please consider visiting us once again during your next trip to Florida hope to see you soon. Nelson SantosDirector of RoomsSheraton Suites Orlando Int'l Airport
1072	3	We stayed here whilst my husband was working and I accompanied him for a holiday. The hotel staff are lovely and extremely helpful. The room maid was a joy. The room itself as the title of the hotel suggests is a suite. Comprising lounge/study area with a fridge, coffee maker (coffee provided) and microwave. There is a desk with WiFi (fairly unreliable) and a hard wire connection (more efficient). A comfortable sofa, easy chair and flat screen TV. The bedroom follows off the lounge and we choose to have a king size bed (other options exist). Bed very comfortable, barely adequate hanging space but sufficient drawers. The bathroom was huge, lighting could be better but is ok. Other facilities include an indoor/outdoor pool with nice patio areas to relax. Pool towels freely available. Bar/Restaurant and Coffee bar is ok with a limited menu. The food we had there was fine. The area is generally hotels and a car is a must since there is very little available within walking distance. Very close to the airport and main road network. Good place to stay if you don't want to be in the thick of all the tourist attractions in Orlando, but can still reach them with ease.Thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed review and especially for your charming words about our staff. We work hard to provide exceptional service and your kind comments are much appreciated by our team. I am also glad to hear that you enjoyed our suites and benefited from our amenities and location. We look forward to welcoming you and your family back in the future!Thank youNelson Santos
1073	4	We just came back from Orlando for our cruise. We stayed one night at the Sheraton Suites Orlando Hotel.5 Minutes drive to and from (MCO) Orlando Int Airport. Restaurant and Bar available and Starbucks counter, coffee for purchase, Heated Pool. The pool is part inside and outside, very cool. Kids had a blast. Hot tub was very hot and close by the pool. Large Lobby with rocking chairs and couches. Free large parking on location and beautiful surrounding.
1074	1	We arrived to find out that the hotel was under refurbishment. We checked into a King Suite on the ground floor (115) and were staying over a weekend (saturday to monday night inclusive). I realise this is a business hotel and the weekends are quiet so it provides the opportunity to refurbish but here is a thought. This is a 2 wing hotel, one wing on each side of the pool. If I were the General Manager I would have arranged the refurb to take place in one wing and then the other thus limiting disturbance to 50 of the hotel and keeping it 100 isolated. Instead the refurb is happening on the third of three floors on both wings and banging noises can be heard throughout the entire hotel. We are frequent travellers and we always require the hotels we stay in to be quiet and 100 comfortable. My wife was ill with a stomach bug and needed to sleep. My daughter is a 20 month old toddler and needs to take sleeps throughout the day. The constant hammering from the workmen prevented this. I contacted the front desk 3 times to complain and the banging continued despite assurances it would be dealt with. I eventually walked to reception with my daughter in my arms and made my grievance known to the staff that I felt I was not being listened to. I was then contacted by staff and told I could move if I wished to another room where no noise was guaranteed. I think they fail to see the point. I don't see why guests should have to repack all their belongings and move to accomodate the disturbance. The disturbance should move or quit to accomodate the guests. It's not rocket science. It's a shame because the hotel is nice and the staff are pleasant. I am not usually easily rattled but banging noises in a hotel - NO WAY!Please allow me to extend my sincerest apologies for the noise disturbance during your stay. I can assure you that many months of careful planning have gone into our renovation and the decision to renovate by floor rather than wing was made based on a number of factors, one being guest safety. Based on the layout of our rooms and elevator location, a different plan would have required our guests to walk through a construction zone to reach their rooms. Not every stage of the renovation is affiliated with noise and the fast majority of our guests are not disturbed at all. I am truly sorry that your wife and daughter were not able to rest peacefully and hope we can make it up to you during your next visit.
1075	2	Ok spacious room. Bed ok not great. No amenities for SPG members let alone platinum members. I had to ask for my welcome gift. Restaurant awful. First warm drinks dusty bottles when having ordered a drink it certainly wasn't cold bottles. Then I was waiting for my breakfast ready to take a shuttle to the airport and the girl said no problem to have an omelet ordered and eaten by the time we had to leave for the shuttle. Well they kept coming back and saying it's almost ready and needless to say it wasn't. I wish she would have saved the trouble and told me to eat the buffet because I left without breakfast. Not an spg property. Won't waste my time staying here again. The Marriott across the way is much better. We always greatly appreciate the feedback of a frequent traveler such as yourself. It is correct that due to the size of our property we do not have an SPG Club Lounge, but offer all other SPG amenities in the Starwood program. You certainly should not have to ask for your welcome gift. We currently have several brand new team members at our front desk and although the SPG program is one of the first training items covered, your feedback allows us to identify need areas. I would also like to apologize for the delay in your breakfast order, which could only have been caused by unusual high volume at the time, which is however certainly not an excuse for not delivering the exceptional level of service that we are known for. We deeply regret the inconvenience we have caused you.
1076	4	The hotel was fine, I enjoyed by stay. It was an older hotel and could use an update but the price was great for what you got. I would recommend skipping the breakfast package and eat at one the places near the hotel. While the staff were friendly, the food was just ok.
1077	5	I stayed in the hotel because of hurricane Irma. It was very stressful time but Gardenia Is very comforting, professional and helpful .I saw her attending a hotel guest on oxygen who needed extra hand and she was there all the time assisting her plus doing her regular duties. GOOD JOB.
1078	4	I booked through Hotwire was a little surprised to find breakfast not included--would have planned around that if I had known. The Shuttle service made up for that. Bed extremely comfortable, Nice lobby, friendly desk people....but....The noisiest plumbing I have ever experienced, anywhere! I do have acute hearing, but to wake up at 1:30 a.m. with the next room neighbor showering! Clunks, thunks, flushing---it might not bother everyone but it startled me, in an otherwise nice place. Trouble with their computer,trying to print a boarding pass, but the desk person was glad to help told me they were working on that.Thank you for taking the time to submit your review and especially for mentioning your positive experiences as well as improvement areas. It is through feedback that we are able to maintain and improve upon our service and product. I sincerely apologize for the plumbing noise and would greatly appreciate if you could contact us with your room number to give us a chance to investigate, since this is not a common occurrence. We hope that if you find yourself in Orlando next time, you will consider staying with us again.
1079	4	Lobby had that old must odor but my room was very nicely remodeled comfortable. Staff was very pleasant helpful. Nice breakfast but you had to get there by 9:00 AM. Overall, a nice stay for the money.
1080	3	Everything about this hotel is small from the room, to the bathroom, elevators and the bar. It was nice, the service was good, but it's small. The fitness center is under construction inaccessible.Hello 104lawandar and thank you for the response. I do want to apologize that the size of the hotel did not meet your standards, we do appreciate your kind words in regards to the staff and will pass them on. We do have an agreement with the New York Sports Club just a few blocks away while our fitness center is being renovated. I do apologize if this information was not passed on to you at check-in. Thank you again for the review and we hope you enjoy the rest of your summer1
1081	3	This was a fairly clean room, king bed. The smallness of the bathroom was our biggest complaint, very inconvenient, you had to step into the small space between the side of the toilet and the counter to get enough room to close the bathroom door. It had a large counter and kitchen sink in the room, with microwave and empty... More
1082	5	A great place to stay when visiting the Portland Oregon area. I had transportation provided by family but there is ample parking available. Across the street are various stores for convenience especially if you forgot something or need some snacks or refreshments.
1083	5	An exelent location for any occasion, semi truck parking just 30 ft at pilot truck stop. Helpful employees. Will recommend easy access to free way and lots of places to eat. 5 star rating was my experience
1084	5	Great place to stay when in the Portland area. Great breakfast, room, sauna, workout facility and spa. The staff has always been extremely professional. The place is quiet at night, and I always sleep well while I am there. Not only do I stay while on business, but I stay while I am on personal travel since it is such... More
1085	5	This was much nicer and more up to date than I was expecting very pleasantly surprised. Very clean, pleasant, up to date room, lobby, hallways. We didn't use the pool/hot tub/etc, so cannot comment on that. Also did not eat breakfast, but did have several cups of excellent coffee - they had two different brews in addition to the decaf,... More
1086	5	This hotel is awesome! The exterior, lobby, and rooms are very nice - especially for the price! I am not sure if the hotel has been recently updated to a more modern look or if it is new, but it was really nice! The King Suite was a great size, and the jetted tub in the bathroom is AMAZING!!! I... More
1087	5	This conveniently located hotel was wonderful. The room was impeccably clean extremely comfortable. The gym had new equipment and breakfast was fabulous. The font desk was well staffed and helpful in getting us transportation. Highly recommend!
1088	5	We arrived around midnight in a snowstorm and yet they made us feel like it was 2 in the afternoon. The rooms are wonderfully spacious and clean. The front desk person working the night shift was especially warm and welcoming. We will stay here anytime we visit Bismarck.
1089	5	Nice place with a good location. Good room with comfortable beds. Also nice breakfast. Only issue I had is that I used my rewards points but my credit card was charged 34.00 without my consent or knowledge...still working through that with them.
1090	5	Room very clean, close to freeways, nice neighborhood , lots of choices to dine, very good internet signal, lots of choices on cable TV. Nice clean area near Toledo, great for business trips to ToledoThanks Dave, we appreciate your good review as it motivate our staff to continue improving our product and service , See you next time your in maumee!!! sincerely, Debbie
1091	5	From the moment we stepped up to the checking desk to the time we left, the checking staff and the food-service people were warm, hospitabie, courteous, and competant. They seemed that they truly wanted our stay to be wonderful. The hotel was nice, and well located. They offer complementary breakfast, afternoon popcorn and sodas, and their 5:30 Kickback. I thought this was a little snack...but no, its a full meal with drinks included (beer, wine or cocktails). What a pleasant surprise after traveling all day we didn't have to find a restaurant! Tanya, Vickie Tyrone were extremely warm and kind to us the entire week. Drury should give these people a raise for the wonderful face they give to the property! They each went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we could want. Thanks gang for a wonderful week! We were so pleased with the warm reception of these folks that we'll look for Drury properties when we next travel.
1092	4	Very nice hotel for a fair price. Friendly staff, excellent rooms with evening cocktails and self serve hot food. A very nice self serve breakfast with ample seating. This is a family and pet friendly hotel. My stay was over a holiday weekend and there were a few sports teams staying here. If you prefer a quite relaxing stay this hotel may not be for you. Kids running in the halls, riding the elevators, and screaming in the pool but then again, that is what kids do! However this may not be the norm since schools just let out. The hotel is close to restaurants and shopping as well as movie theaters. It is right off Interstate 17 so easy off easy on.
1093	5	Driving into the small parking lot of the hotel, I wasn't sure what to expect. It looked like they really tried to give a garden feel to it with hanging succulents and different plants all around. I arrived at 11, too early to check in but they let me park in their lot for the 15 (wish it were included),. The parking area is small but backing in helps. I have a Jeep Cherokee and had no problems. The room was small but clean and cute. I was there for a bachelorette party and fake diamond rings were hidden around the room, so I can attest to the cleanliness since 9 girls looked for rings in almost every inch of the room. One downside of the hotel was being woken up a couple different times by sirens and honking but it is the downtown area. Breakfast was very nice- pancakes, sausages, eggs, different breads and muffins, cereal, yogurt, granola, fruit, almond milk, teas and coffee. There was a waffle maker but I didn't see batter. The woman working in the breakfast area was very efficient and helpful. They had a nice little seating area outside and tables and seats outside some of the rooms. The hotel was walking distance to everything we did, maybe a 10 min walk. I would stay again. Hi Ms Ana N,Our entire team at Best Western Cabrillo Garden Inn would like to thank you for staying at our property. It felt good knowing that you had a wonderful and pleasant stay. We look forward for your next visit to San Diego.Best!YChen
1094	4	Good value for the money. I always stay here when in downtown San Diego. Most other hotels are either fully booked or way too expensive. Keep in mind this is a Best Western, don't expect the Ritz Carlton...Dear Jeff P,We appreciate your business and your review regarding your stay at the Best Western Cabrillo Garden Inn San Diego.Thank you again for staying at our hotel and we are looking forward to have you as our guest in the future.Y ChenGeneral Manager
1095	5	Convenient location for access to the highway, airport, and within walking distance to the Gaslamp Quarter for a night out. Rooms were clean, breakfast offered good variety, and the rooftop garden is a particularly nice touch in the middle of downtown. The only reason I wouldn't tell someone to book this hotel was if they disliked hotels with rooms open to the outside. The parking lot, while convenient, was sometimes a tight fit.Dear Lauren H, Thank you for your comments regarding your stay at our property Best Western Cabrillo Garden Inn.We are glad that you have enjoyed the rooms as well as the hotels location and we hope to see you back soon.Y ChenGeneral Manager
1096	3	Staff was friendly and responsive. I asked for directions one time and the check-in lady was overly-helpful. The continental breakfast in the morning was not your crappy bread and fruit breakfast. They actually had eggs, bacon/sausage and other good foods. We were pleasantly surprised. The location was very close to the Gaslamp. A little bit of a walk, but not bad at all. The rooms were small...I would say a little too small for the price.Would try to find somewhere else next time...for the same price, but would resort to the Cabrillo Inn, if necessary.
1097	4	We were in town for a conference and were looking for an affordable place to stay. The Best Western Cabrillo was an excellent choice. The rooms were nice, the continental breakfast was helpful, and the staff was very courteous. I would stay there again.Dear Dave D, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Best Western Cabrillo Garden Inn and for taking the time to share your experience you had at our property. We are appreciating your comments and we hope to have you as our guest in the near future.Y ChenGeneral Manager
1098	5	I want to comment on the outstanding service I received from Lindsey. The zipper on my motorcycle boots had broken, and Lindsey found some duct tape with which to secure my boots. Great service there. Then, I managed to drop a cup of coffee in the hallway, and Lindsey handled that issue with grace and friendliness. She was great. The... More
1099	5	My family commits to the Hampton in Palestine each and every year for our family reunion. The staff is Soooo amazing and soooo helpful. Cleanliness is top notch at this hotel. I can continue on and on, but so you know, the Hampton is definitely the hotel to stay at while in the Palestine area.
1100	5	During my business visit to Palestine, TX, stayed at Hampton Inn and Suits. Very comfortable beds, clean rooms, and the house keeping was trustworthy. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and I will continue staying there for my trips to the town.
1101	5	Location of a planned second high school class reunion and we have already make arrangements for a third in succession, based on such complete satisfaction with accommodations, service and food quality.
1102	4	Traveled to the Polar Express and stayed at this hotel that evening. The hotel first impression, I was extremely annoyed. After traveling from Houston to Palestine with 3 small children and a lot of luggage/stuff that comes with small children there were NO luggage carts anywhere, we even waited for one and someone else snagged it. All night only 1... More
1103	4	The hotel is fine. Nothing major to complain about. The hallways and stairs needed better vacuuming. The room was clean and quiet. The people at the desk were quick and efficient. Overall a good choice.
1104	5	Clean, quiet and roomy. Friendly staff and great breakfast. Stayed for one night after visiting Honeymoon Island. It was a convenient location for us. We found some great rates for this hotel probably due to off season, regardless it was a great stay.
1105	4	I say it's the real deal because the place lives up to the positive reviews I read before staying here about two weeks ago. I travel to Miami about 6 to 8 times a year to visit family and I feel like I'm becoming an expert on where to stay for what. Technically, you could stay at this hotel and never leave the immediate area, and be okay. The place is clean, new, well kept, relaxing, with a friendly staff. The bathroom is pretty excellent and the room I was in felt enormous. (bathrobes included btw) The pool looked great, but it rained when I was there. I also saw a lot of space to lounge around outside if the weather permitted. Because of the design, architecture and foliage, when you're in the motel, you feel like you're in a private spot. You can't really see out which is nice. This helps create an atmosphere. If you venture outside the grounds, there's plenty of small restaurants within walking distance: the place is on a block with at least 5 restaurants to the south. To the north, things are waiting to be updated including 2 other motels. I think when they are done, this area will really come alive.I parked for free, which is hard to find in Miami. The neighborhood was safe, so I ordered from a few restaurants online and walked to pick up food. They were working on an onsite diner which I think would complete the whole experience when done. Location-wise, it's subjective. It's kind of off the beaten path in terms of South Beach or Downtown, but I liked being on Biscayne Blvd. And with a car, I could drive right up to the Aventura mall and the Gulfstream Casino, but I also wasn't too far to get to family in Miami Beach. Where it is on Biscayne makes it relatively easy to get around and you skip a lot of the freeway traffic. I'll definitely keep my eye on this place. I'd love to stay again when the diner is done and the weather permits for some poolside bar time. I'm also curious how this area will develop in the next few years.Thank you so much for such a lovely review and we do hope you return soon. The restaurant should re-open in early October as upscale Sushi so hopefully you can plan your next trip in the fall. The area has certainly changed since we totally renovated the hotel back in 2014, with only a few more buildings still in need of renovations. Stay tuned as the neighborhood continues to change!
1106	4	The hotel is modern, in a retro way - clean with excellent fittings and friendly staff. Pictures on the web-site depict what you get very well and it is well-positioned for North Miami, if that is where you really want to be.Why didn't I rate it as excellent Basically, the neighborhood still has a ways to improve, so it is not a destination area in itself. The excellent restaurant on site is closed on Mondays (one of the two nights we were there) and the breakfast is basic. Nevertheless, we felt welcomed and enjoyed the large, comfy room.We are so happy to know that you enjoyed your stay/room and felt welcomed by the staff! We certainly look forward to your return visit to Miami.We are centrally located as the airport, downtown Miami, the beach and most major attractions in Miami are only 15 minutes away from the hotel. It is true that our complimentary breakfast is basic as it consists of coffee/tea/OJ, croissants, yogurt, english muffins, cream cheese and jam.
1107	5	We stayed here for 4 nights during our travels around America and it was great!We were greeted warmly and they gave us a quiet room away from the pool where they played music in the evenings.The room itself was big and the bed was super comfy! They had a great bathroom set up for doing hair and make up and the shower was really good too.The staff were really helpful when we wanted an Everglades tour and the breakfast was a good add on with bagels, cereal and yoghurts to choose from.I would strongly recommend and stay again.Hello Amy, thank you so much for sharing your Vagabond experience and we hope you return to the hotel soon.
1108	5	The Vagabond Hotel is a charming, comfortable option for a Miami stay. The pool tucked in the center of the hotel makes it seem like a hidden oasis. The spacious rooms have everything you need and the staff is very friendly. The pool bar is a total bonus. Sebastian and the rest of the bar staff are very nice and attentive. The place has a cool, hip vibe but with out the South Beach attitude. I would definitely come back here for another weekend getaway and recommend it to people looking for a fun, easy place to stay in Miami.So glad you selected the Vagabond for your staycation! The locals have discovered how relaxing it is to hang out by the pool during the day and enjoy the pool bar and the entertainment on Friday and Saturday nights. We look forward to welcoming you back!!!
1109	4	We were in Miami to visit family and had stumbled across this motel via the web and felt between the unique look and great location, it was worth a gamble. We were not disappointed. In fact, if it was not for one item, we would have rated the motel excellent.I told my wife that this motel was like an oasis amidst the neighborhood commercial buildings. The amount of landscaping around the pool area and rooms provided a sense of privacy and relaxation. It has an old fashioned look from the outside, which is repeated within the rooms themselves. The rooms were plenty large, the bed was very comfortable, the air-conditioning kept us comfortable, even though we faced the hotter western sun. And the sound-proofing was such that we could barely notice the music being played at night at the pool bar. The shower is quite large, but is also the source of my complaint. During showers, water would go from comfortable to very hot to very cold, even though we had not touched the settings. If you waited a few seconds, the temperature would go back to normal, but it was a true annoyance. I agree the continental breakfast was slim, but was very pleased to see that it was constantly restocked very often. And the best part was the coffee. My wife is so tired of watered down hotel coffee. She really enjoyed the morning brew and that is saying something.Every staff member we came in contact with was friendly and helpful. As noted, the restaurant is currently closed for renovation, which was a disappointment as our family had told us how enjoyable it is. Also, please note that parking is in a horseshoe shape on the outside edge of the building. We had no concerns about the neighborhood, but would certainly advise against having anything of value visible in the car. Would we stay here again Absolutely yes, but we would hope that the shower issue has been resolved in the future.Thank you so very much for your feedback and so glad you truly enjoyed your stay. Hopefully you will be returning sooner rather than later. We do service our heaters on an annual basis even though they are relatively new and in fact they were serviced less than a month ago which is why I am quite irritated that you experienced temperature fluctuations in your room. Another service call has been made and the issue will be dealt with promptly.By the way, we always advise guests not to leave valuable items in their cars anywhere in Miami.
1110	5	I spent three nights in their ADA compliant room after having major knee surgery. The staff was highly professional and the room was immaculate and gorgeous. When you're in pain the last thing you need are hassles and my Vagabond experience was entirely hassle-free. The Vagabond was a blessing during a time of need.We hope you are on your way to a speedy recovery! We look forward to your return visit.
1111	1	Another cheap and unpleasant Durango, CO motel. Paper thin walls, dirty, curtain had holes and shredded edges, no hair dryer, no kleenex. I just needed one night's rest and didn't want to pay 150 at the nicer places but this room wasn't worth it.
1112	5	Clean, spacious and comfortable. Checking in and out is a breeze. Cute part of Manhattan. Still top notch. We got the King suite. It was worth the extra 10 to have more room. The linens are high quality, too.Thanks for the review Tammy! We're glad you enjoyed our hotel and the newly developed downtown. Between the bakery, local restaurants, and new IMAX theater within walking distance, it's the best place to get a taste of Manhattan. We hope to have you back soon.
1113	4	Excellent hotel...great value. We got in really late and I had called and the front desk went ahead and checked us in. They had our keys out and waiting for us when we finally arrived. Beautiful room, very clean.
1114	3	There 4 nights. One very cold morning there was no hot water. Had to have maintenance turn on the heat. Staff is very good. Excellent breakfast, free for certain Hilton Honors. I stay there often (business) and is usually a very good experience.Thank you for your feedback and glad to hear you enjoyed your stay. My sincere apologizes for the mishaps you encountered and glad to hear my staff quickly rectified the situation. I hope travels brings you in the area soon so we can welcome you back .
1115	4	The hotel was very conveniently located for a business trip to Dallas and the staff was really accommodating. The rooms seemed to be recently remodeled and modern and the hotel restaurant had an outstanding breakfast.Dear Aaron R - Thank you for taking time to share your experience at Hilton Garden Inn Dallas Market Center. We're so glad that you were well satisfied with your accommodations, and we look forward to welcoming you again soon. We really appreciate your kind words, thanks again!
1116	4	Just a one night stay but a good one. Room was clean, nice sized restroom, and price was good. Breakfast was tasty with a number of options. Staff was fantastic, morning and the evening prior. Good stay.
1117	4	The hotel aesthetically appealing. The room was spacious and clean for the most part, except the tub was a little. The restaurant was good, all facilities and the internet access were excellent. The staff was friendly and there was plenty of parking lot space. The location was ideal for the business trip at hand. Thanks.
1118	3	The hotel is in a good area and I felt comfortable going in and out. The only negative on this trip was the lady at the front desk. I checked in about 10AM and had no reservations. She as very short with me and only stated what was necessary, she spoke very fast, did not make any eye contact and continued talking even when she turned away. I felt like I was inconveniencing her. I expected much more friendliness and hospitality from the front desk.I also tried to reserve a shuttle to the airport for the next morning, but she told me she did not have the papers to make the reservation and I should just do it the next morning. I did about 715, but was then told by the morning front desk crew that the shuttle was already booked until 1130.Breakfast buffet is good. Food and staff was not ready at start time, but were very friendly.Ensure you book hotel shuttle as early as you can.
1119	5	there are two people to look for at this marriott roseville tyler and jamie are thew best service minded gentalmen ive met i hope all can expieriance there smiles an service if you ever need anything there always rite on the spot injoy
1120	5	We became timeshare owners 12 years ago, and we travel a lot. This was our first time ever to stay at our home property. The service was wonderful, the staff pleasant, and the suites beautiful. It wa a wonderful stay. Two critiques, 1. the movie that was played in the evening was rated PG13, and our small children 3 and 6 were not able to stay in the pool because of it, and when we went to the other pool, it was a lot of young adults smoking and drinking.Thank you for a perfect review, Cat! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your villa here at Marriott's Grand Chateau. Your feedback is very important to us and has been shared with our senior resort management.
1121	5	My family and I had an incredible time at The Lodge. We stayed in a family room and it was the perfect size for the four of us, equipped with a microwave and refrigerator too. The dcor was everything wed hoped for, log cabin style walls/ceiling and we were also told that all the log furniture was made in Montana.... More
1122	3	We have stayed a few times and have enjoyed ourselves every time. Our only complaint is that we wish they would stick with the train theme throughout rather than having the train building and lobby with various themes for the rooms themselves. Make them all train themed rooms!

1124	3	Cute place. Nice little walk to the beach. My family picked up our key for us, because we were arriving late. They allowed us to pay later the next morning. Photos are of the path to the ocean. And from room 15 deck.
1125	5	Moonstone Beach Motel is a great new building. We were in Room 3, which is up a few steps to the first floor. The view of the ocean from the room is amazing. The walk to the beach is a short one through the sand dunes. The beach is good for walking and there usually aren't many people on it.... More
1126	3	We checked into a fountain view room (premium view room)on Sunday. The fountains/music broke down SHORTLY after dark. The next two days or view was the pond drained and workers occasionally powerwashing the rocks and looking at mechanicals. There were saws (like another reviewer commented) beginning early in the morning. They are working on an Alcatraz exhibit and apparently the... More
1127	4	We are a couple in our 60's typically enjoy a resort away from the action and nightlife but we thoroughly enjoyed our 4 night stay at this resort! The suite was small, quiet, where the action was! It was wonderful being able to take the elevator to all the action! The room was new, very clean and although... More
1128	5	Awesome hotel and great location. Hotel is very new and extremely clean. Hotel pools are very nice and dinnining facilities are great. First time staying on property but long time Hilton member. Will stay again when visiting area.
1129	5	I was afraid looking at reviews on Trip advisor. but I don't have a option and I paid for initial 1st week. Surprisingly it was really nice experience. Motel manager was friendly. explained me of weekly deal. its really cheaper if u pay weekly but u wont get refund if u check out early. its pretty much common in in... More
1130	2	The housekeepers couldn't speak English and the bathrooms were dirty. The TV didn't work and the floors weren't even vacuumed all the way. I paid over 100 a night for a dirty room.

1131	4	I stayed here for four nights this month after flying down to see the MLB All-Star game. I booked my room online and checked in via the Hilton app the night before my arrival. This enabled me to choose my room (I chose one on the 7th floor- the top floor). Accessing the hotel is easy to do, as it is right off of a highway. The location isn't in the greatest area, as there was always heavy traffic when turning back onto the main road leaving the hotel. Dining options on the main road near the hotel aren't great either. Check-in when I arrived was quick and easy and took less than a minute. Everything in the room appeared clean. The beds were extremely comfortable. Every employee at the hotel seemed to enjoy their job and was friendly. The hotel includes an outdoor pool, an exercise room, a guest laundry area, and a business center with two computers and printers. It also has a small area to the left of the front desk that sells a variety of items, including snacks, frozen meals, ice cream, and beverages (including beer). If there was one area the hotel could improve in, it would be having thicker walls. At night, I didn't hear much noise. However, every morning around eight o'clock, voices in rooms around me woke me up and made it hard to sleep. I'm not sure if it was the guests in those rooms or the housekeeping staff, but it seemed to occur every morning I was there. As for noise from airplanes (considering the hotel is close to the airport), the room was quiet late at night, but not so much once the sun came up. All things considered, I would definitely stay here again if I were to return to Miami. The rates were very reasonable, especially considering what other hotels in the city were charging. Also, the parking is free.
1132	3	First the positive - check in was a breeze, the room was in great condition, it was quiet, the air conditioning was great, the breakfast was good, there's food nearby although many places don't stay open very late, they even provide mouthwash with the free toiletries which was a nice touch, they welcome their HHonors members very well, had nice 12 shuttle to the port, and the free airport shuttle was prompt when called.Now the problem - they tried to kick us out of our a room a day early. They didn't even tell us, they just gave someone else a keycard that gave them access to our room. Thankfully we were there when they tried to gain entry so we were able to stop them. The other guest went back to the lobby and the front desk called us and told us we weren't supposed to be there and to get out. I explained that I had booked for 2 days. They accused me of lying so I offered to present proof of my reservation, they put me on hold and when they eventually came back they accused me of checking out a day early. I told them that was clearly untrue since I was still in the room. They muttered an apology and hung up on me. If it hadn't been for this one interaction I would have rated them excellent but given that they put our safety and property at risk and made accusations that were untrue I simply can't rate them better than average. It was one thing but the severity was too serious. They didn't do anything to make up for it. I mentioned it in the survey they sent me but there was no follow-up.
1133	3	convenient location very near the airport. The staff is very welcoming and they give you a good start and keep up the good work until one leaves. food not great and more variety needed but I guess for an airport hotel is ok.
1134	1	Stayed here after a long flight was supposed to be for two days. But lasted one night. Was in room 210 but complained after first night due to noise from being next to the elevators and the air conditioning unit at the window and on the roof outside. Staff were indiferent to the problem said they couodnt help as the hotel was full. (All flights from NYC and Washington Area were cancelled due to storms so in bound passengers didnt arrive) the room card offered complete satisfaction or money back but this was not honoured as apoarently we had paid in advance. I assume the money that came out of my bank was coverted to play money by the time they got it so the guarantee was invalid!!!! I asked for a taxi and got their mini bus who charged 50 to go downtown. I was conned into this hotel by the Hilton brand name huge mistake on my part.Hi,We are sorry we were not able to provide you with the quality of services you deserve. This is not typical of our hotel and staff, and we are always looking for ways to improve our customer experience, we will address this issues you encounter with the proper departments to avoid from happening again. Your satisfaction is very important to us and we try hard to make sure all of our guests have a rewarding stay. Thank you again for your feedback and we hope you will consider staying with us again.Best regards,Maria C.
1135	5	My sister died and all the front desk staff was comforting. Their smiles helped us through this difficult time. The rooms were ready when we arrived and they out us all on the same floor. This helped when organizing transportation
1136	1	The night audit need to learn how to assist with guesses needs and act like he cares.the housekeeper's on the 6th floor need learn how to eye contact and speak to the guesses the inspector need to be put back in training Dear msdenise25watson:I am sorry to see that you did not have a good experience at our hotel, please accept my apologies.This is not the image we wanted you to have and I would appreciate if you could send me a direct message with more details on the issues that you encountered.This will greatly help us to improve and provide better service to our guests.Kind regards,Mauricio Martins - Area General Managermauricio.martinshilton.com
1137	5	I stayed on points around NYE when most hotels were sold out in Miami as I was traveling there for a bowl game. I was happy to find that it was clean the staff was warm and inviting. The service at breakfast was good. Breakfast is 12.95 or complementary for Gold and Diamond Members. Located right of the expressway it makes it easy to get around and really a quick trip to Sun Life Stadium.

1140	3	Brianna and Bella are awesome. I love how they welcome me and my husband to hotel and thank you for the free chips. know how to make new guest feel very welcome. And also my other friends who came to join us.Izzy, thank you for choosing us while here for your birthday celebration. We are glad to read you had a nice time here and that our staff took great care of you. We will be sure to share your compliments with the team, especially Brianna Bella. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest, and we hope to see you again soon. Sincerely,Hotel Management
1141	3	Stayed here for a few nights while in town for a trade show at the Cobb Galleria. This hotel has easy access to the Cobb Galleria as it is connected. The location of the hotel is about 30 minutes outside of downtown Atlanta. You will definitely need a car to get around. The hotel itself is modern and updated. It looks like the rooms have been recently renovated. The reason I gave the hotel only 3 stars is because there were a few hiccups during my stay. I don't want to get into specifics and make this whole review, a complaint. I would recommend the hotel if staying in the area for business. Other then that, I would look into downtown Atlanta.I am very sorry to hear you had a few hicups while in my hotel. I would like to hear more about them if you have the time to call me. My name is Joe Uhl and I can be reached at 770 303 3186. Thank you for the feedback!
1142	5	Hey had a wonderful time at the hotel!! Staff was very helpful, I had one problem with a parking attendant he banged on the back of my car to move, I was waiting patiently for some kids to go by safely on the side walk.We are glad you had an awesome time with us! Please come back again the next time business or pleasure bring you to Atlanta. Thank you for the feedback on the Valet Attendant, I will follow up with my team to ensure we use a better approach!
1143	5	From now on this is my go-to place in Atlanta. I have stayed at various hotels on the northside of Atlanta. No more. I am staying at the Renassiance Waverly exclusively from now on. Although they were undergoing rennovation on three florrs, they did everything to accomodate me during my stay. Great room, great breakfast and great service. It's the bomb!This review really put a smile of my face! Thank you so much for the kind comments, we are thrilled to be your hotel of choice! I am also very pleased the renovation was not disruptive to you, we will be done at the end of March and will then have all new guest rooms! We hope to see you back with us very soon.
1144	4	I stayed here for a night, to attend a meeting held at the hotel. The room was very good. The staff was excellent. Even thought all of the rooms empty out into the courtyard area, it still is fairly quiet (thankfully). The hotel itself is well located, there is plenty of parking, and there are many options for eating within the hotel. The breakfast buffet was pretty good and that was a decent price for a buffet (14). The only complaint I have is they charge a small fortune for most everything! A 20 ounce soft drink is 3.49, A small bag of chips or pretzels are 2 for 3.49. Ok, most people might not care, but to me, if I am paying a decent amount for the room, why do I need to be gouged for every day itemsI don't believe I will stay here again, unless there is another business meeting, to which I need to attend.Thank you for your feedback, it truly helps us improve our product and services. I will review our pricing with my Operations Manager to ensure we are competitive and not over priced. I hope to see you back at the Waverly in the future!
1145	5	Strongly recommend this property as long as you do not have to come and/or go to downtown at rush hour. It took us only 15-20 minutes to reach High Museum, Coke, Aquarium at 9:30 and return at 3:30. The property itself is very nice and the staff more that helpful/friendly. We will visit again.Thank you for staying with us! We hope to have you back very soon.
1146	4	This really is a nice hotel. Executive King Room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Large screen tv. Fridge in room was pretty quiet ( a good thing!) Comfortable bed. Club food was also surprisingly good, fresh and well maintained. Staff was friendly and helpful. This hotel has a large central atrium. It is connected via a pedestrian bridge over the busy road to a very nice mall ( and a nice but not very busy one on the walk ). Lots of parking. Just across the freeway from the new Braves stadium will make this a very desirable place although does not look like this is a very pedestrian friendly area in general and no apparent easy walking route to the stadium.I have great news, there is a pedestrian bridge being build outside my hotel to the Braves stadium. It is scheduled to be open for the first pitch next year making the area around the hotel even more exciting! Come back and see us soon!
1147	3	I will start by saying the room was lovely. However, the front desk staff was just par. Considering this is a Renaissance, a bit more friendly, helpful would have been nice. The hotel is ridiculously huge, so just exiting it, takes a GPS! Loved the location, as we are walkers, and walked the bridge to some great hangouts.Thank you for the feedback. We are glad to hear that overall you enjoyed your stay with us and hope that you will choose us again in the future.
1148	4	We recently stayed for one night at this hotel. We being me, my husband, and 3 of our children, ages 4, 3, and 9 months. The hotel was beautiful and the atmosphere elegant. I was not there at check-in, but it must have gone smoothly since my husband did it alone with all the kids while I was at a meeting and didn't complain!The kids enjoyed the indoor pool. However, the key did not work at first to get into the pool, requiring my husband to trek across the hotel and lobby with everyone in their swimsuits to get a new keycard.The room service was good, but I would have liked more choices, especially on the late night menu. And make sure to ask about a kids entree choices and prices, since they are not printed on the room service menu.Our room on the 14th floor was large and had 2 queen beds, a desk and chair, and a nice lounge chair. There was a good view, too!We got a good AAA rate of 99 a night.The only problem I had was with the billing, but it was fixed. We had to change our reservation to 1 night instead of 2. The bill I got had charged us as a no show for the first night, even though I had changed the reservation online in plenty of time. Also, there was a 9.95 internet fee that we didn't use. Both charges were taken off the bill, but it was still a hastle to have to address it at all.I would stay here again if I could get the same rate. However, I think hotels of this caliber should offer free internet, which draws me to other hotels.
1149	4	Spent 4 nights here on a business trip. Rooms are comfortable and spacious. Service was great and had very little to complain about. Location of hotel is very convenient if you need to be in that area. A bit far out if you want to travel to downtown and airport...shops and restaurants however are close by so all in all if you on business and not pleasure then being far from downtown is not too big a problem.Thank you for the feedback on your recent trip, I am pleased you enjoyed yourself and hope to see you back soon!
1150	3	Arriving in the middle of the afternoon on a business trip, I chose to forego grabbing fast food at the airport, and instead took my shuttle directly to the Renaissance Waverly Hotel. Big mistake. After a quick (and delightful) check-in, I rushed up to my King-sized room and changed clothes, hoping to run back downstairs and grab a very late lunch/early dinner. No such luck. No cafe or restaurant in the hotel was open during the day except for very specific lunch hours (11a - 2p). I was out of luck until 5:30pm - more than 2 hours away. I was famished! So I went back downstairs and put my credit card on file so I could order room service with its ridiculous delivery fee and separate room service charge. I know most hotels do this, but for a convention center with travelers arriving at all hours of the day, at least have a coffee/snack shop open! So far, this has left a bad taste in my mouth (because I am still waiting for room service, it's all I've had in my mouth!)I really appreciate your feedback and agree with you that you should be able to get a bite to eat in the afternoon. When the restaurant is closed we have Tosca Blu (lounge) open and do serve a pretty extensive menu. I am very sorry we did not make that clear to you and will follow up with my team. Please call me when you are coming back to town, I would like to take special care of you the next time you are with us!
1151	3	We stayed here on a road trip for a few nights whilst we visited Six Flags. It was s short drive to the park (15-20mins) and close by to the mall and restaurants.The room in this hotel was fine. The first night was spoiled by noise from the suite next door (not the hotel's fault) - but the walls must be thin and you would have hoped they would have dealt with this.We found many of the staff were abrupt (however, one of the security men helped find some milk for our infant late at night, which was great service). The Coffee Shop was also expensive. No big issues, just an average hotel that did a job for us.Thank you for sharing your experience with me, it always helps to get feedback. I will share your comments with me team and promise the next time you are here you will have a terrific experience!
1152	4	The facility is beautiful and so close to restaurants.(Has one in the atrium) It's a little on the pricey side but its very secure. The staff with the exception of the lady at check in time were very nice and courteous. Checking out was smooth and the young man that helped with check out, more than made up for the check in experience.I appreciate you taking the time to complete a critique of my hotel. I am very pleased you enjoyed your stay but would love to learn more about your check in experience. If you have the chance, would like to talk to you via telephone, my number is 770 303 3186 and my name is Joe Uhl. Hope you have a wonderful Holiday!
1153	4	I've stayed at this hotel for 10+ years and it is continuing to get better. While traveling through Atlanta last night I made a point of spending the night here but I was very disappointed to find that on multiple occasions, the offerings were trimmed because of a group in the hotel. The bar was serving a limited off-menu food service and the breakfast buffet, even though the front desk said it was the full buffet was only a limited, cheaper option for the group. I was really looking forward to a waffle and omelet, which of course weren't on the buffet today. If you're going to offer special pricing for a group, don't not offer your non attending guests full options. Thank you for your feedback. I will be sure to share it with our team. We hope that you choose to stay with us again and give our hotel another try.
1154	5	This hotel is conveniently located near great dining and shopping just about 10 minutes from downtown Atlanta. We experienced very good customer service in all key areas. The onsite parking was extensive and easy to deal with.Thank you for staying with us, hope to see you soon!
1155	4	Upon my arrival here and stay for the night on a business trip I checked out this place online to see my value and what it had to offer for me. Walking into this place I was greeted with such respect and helpful people. I was very impressed with the lay out mostly the front door takes you right in front of the elevator so that I don' have to walk around to find my room or look for the elevators to take me up to the 6th floor. Once in the room I was very impressed with the mattress set they had to offer. Taking me to a deep and very comfy sleep. If there is one thing that I like to make sure hotels have to offer me is to have full 4G cell phone coverage on all floors, so that I can stay connected with my business partners and family while on the road. I have noticed in certain locations I did not have my full strength coverage as needed. This could be a very big improvement for any type of guest that may raise their customer experience while staying here.Thank you so much for your feedback, it really helps us understand what is working well and where we have opportunity. I will look into the cell phone strength and see what we can do to ensure we offer the best connection. We look forward to seeing you back with us soon!
1156	5	The king size room on the corner is very big with many amenities. The bed is very comfortable. The refrigerator is bigger than normal hotel refrigerators. The concierge room is big. The one night we were there the appetizers were a limited, but desserts were very good.Thank you for the review of my hotel, we appreciate your comments and hope to have you back with us soon!
1157	5	My husband and I were here last weekend for our anniversary. It was our first time staying here. What a gorgeous hotel! The grounds are immaculate and the rooms are lovely. The staff were all friendly and very welcoming from the moment we arrived. Everyone we encountered from valet, check-in, to the lady who delivered our room service breakfast were all very pleasant and nice. I must mention and give thanks to Alex from security. My husband realized on our way home that he left his ipad in the room. We called and were connected to Alex and he got our phone number and said he would check the room himself and get back to us. We promptly received a call back that he found it and arranged to have it next day aired back to us. We were so happy when it arrived! We really appreciate the professionalism shown by Alex and your hotel. We will be back and will highly recommend this hotel to friends and family! Love Estancia!Thank you for taking the time to write a review and for recognizing Alex as an outstanding employee- we couldnt agree more! Im so glad that you got your iPad back safe and sound. Thank you for recommending our hotel to your friends and family. We look forwarding to welcoming them to property.
1158	5	We had such a great time right after the Christmas parties and family gatherings at work, home. We had a beautiful room in the new decorated section, the food at Mustangs Burros was delicious. We enjoyed our champagne at the front desk very much:) The breakfast was delicious I had the Bread pudding which we were told by Jose that this will take a while to bake, we were fine and looked forward to the bread pudding. It was a Frittata made with Crossants ..yum.Gaby the concierge was very helpful and gave us some information for a possible wedding for our daughter. Later that evening we returned to our room to a bottle of Cabernet wine. We were very grateful to the all of the staff at the Estancia Hotel and we look forward to returning to this wounderful hotel. I almost forgot the front desk lady Erica was intuned to all of our needs, and the vallet young man made sure we had a map to our next location and gave us some water bottles for our journey. You all are very considerate. Thank you again.Thank you so much for the 5-star review and the kind comments about our wonderful staff. We are very lucky to have such a great team and will be sure to share your review with everyone. Please let us know if we can help with your daughters wedding, our Catering team is absolutely fabulous. Just give us a call when you are ready. (PS Im definitely craving the breakfast bread pudding now!)
1159	5	What a great find.. beautiful grounds,lots of different plants etc. The two restaurants were both very tasty and the prices were within reason..The Mustang for dinner has some nice craft brews on draft which was a plus.Complimentary coffe in the breakfast / lunch restaurant.Great relaxing pool area , staff was super friendly. Will certainly coming back soon..Thank you for taking the time to share such positive feedback with us on Trip Advisor. We are ecstatic to hear you enjoyed both Mustangs Burros and Adobe El Restaurante. We are also very pleased to hear your complements on the staff and will be sure to pass them along. We hope to have the honor of welcoming you back soon!
1160	4	A dozen old friends decided to take advantage of a special offer at the Estancia to spend some time together. In a sentence, we had a wonderful time. The staff were each helpful and friendly. A gardener stopped what he was doing to give me directions (the grounds are very large and could use a few more directional signs). The concierge advised us of some restaurants with water views that could accommodate our group and made the reservation for us.The rooms at our price point, while not impressive looking, were roomy enough, very clean, had large flat screen TVs, and nice toiletries. The bathroom was modern with marble counter top. Hair dryer and iron were provided. One pricing feature I liked was the hospitality fee. Instead of being nickeled and dimed for different extras, the most common ones are all in one fee which included access to the exercise area, wi-fi, bottled water, a welcome drink in the lobby, morning coffee in the wine bar, and a free margarita (very tasty) in the bar. Our special offer included valet parking. The hotel was very busy with several weddings and other events, but the valets never kept us waiting longer than 5-10 minutes. There is a lavish buffet breakfast on the weekends which is 22, more than my budget allows for breakfast. The server told us that for half that price, we could have a 'continental breakfast' which included all the cold items, even smoked salmon with capers and also hot oatmeal. That was a good deal.Located directly across from University of California San Diego and adjacent to the Salk Institute, this property is not right on the beach, but there are walking trails next to the hotel. While the shops and attractions of La Jolla and San Diego are nearby, the Estancia provides a tranquil retreat from the crowds. Our room on the ground floor was rather dark. I would request a room on the third floor next time. A major refurbishing is planned for early 2013 which should brighten up the rooms. I would also have liked more outdoor places to sit and relax with my friends. We had a very enjoyable stay.Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review. Your comments and feedback are very much appreciated by the team here at the hotel as well as potential future guests. It sounds like you had a nice time catching up with old friends, and Im glad our concierge was able to assist your group with a fun and memorable night out. We hope to welcome you back for the next reunion!
1161	4	The rooms are very clean and bed and linens are excellent. There is a tub/shower and a single sink. I was surprised it did not have a separate shower. The layout of the resort is confusing and somewhat difficult to find your way around. There is a very nice coffee/snack shop. The staff was very accommodating. There is a 30 per night resort fee which includes amenities that are customarily included in the base rate for comparable accommodations. In addition, they charge 25 per night for self-parking. It is well located between Del Mar and La Jolla. I did not eat here, but in conversation with others, the restaurant has a good reputation.
1162	5	Estancia is very nicely secluded, very quiet with a fantastic staff. The valet guys were super friendly, the concierge was helpful and the ladies taking care of our rooms did great. The pool was very nice and all the on site restaurants were fantastic. It is secluded. Depending on your view of this it can be a bit of a drive to other eating establishments in Del Mar or La Jolla. We will certainly return. It was highly recommended by our friends as well.
1163	5	Excellent Resort. Beautiful location, Ambience, Impeccable service, clean rooms, free Internet and delcious food.
1164	5	I want to thank all of the staff at the Estancia for the wonderful service for our meeting we had in April. Even with the additional guest due to the fires they were accommodating and very friendly. My daughter and I, along with a friend and her daughter stayed and additional two days to have a little vacation before her wedding in June, We had a massage planned and just relaxing by the pool. My daughter spotted a bathing suit cover up, purchased it and wore it during her bachelor party in Cabo two week later. She lost it and loved it. I called Estancis spa t and spoke to Heather ( who had helped us previously with our massage and the purchase of the coverup), she remembered exactly who we were and which one. They did not have anymore but was able to get the designer name, look it up on line and find the exact one! She gave me all this information so I could purchase another one and surprise my daughter. This is going above and beyond! We will be coming back again and certainly will go to the spa again! Thank you Heather!! Thank you Deb and Sarah!Thank you for taking the time to share your wonderful experience on Trip Advisor. Your review gives us the opportunity to specifically praise and congratulate our well-deserved staff for providing exceptional experiences! We are pleased to hear Heather was able to assist with your purchase and make a connection with her guests. We look forward to welcoming you again soon!
1165	4	ServiceThe moment we pulled onto the drive of the Estancia, we were greeted in the most welcoming manner by the friendly valet. This set the bar high which every single employee met for our entire two evening stay. This is so rare but when I mean every single employee, I mean it! From housekeeping to front desk to restaurant servers to even the gardeners!SpaThe spa is great with especially lovely out door hot tub areas. My prenatal massage was great 9i dozed!) and my husband, who was apprehensive at first because he's only experienced a few of them, came out super relaxed and happy.PoolThe pool area is nice and saline water a major plus.FoodThe food was fine -- not exceptional like the service. We ate at Adobe and Mustangs and had room service. The one standout dish was a shrimp quesadilla appetizer from Mustangs - so delicious. Everything was was fine - seemed like standard hotel-y food.RoomOur room was nice but not luxurious - thin and surprisingly spartan walls. We had a veranda room which is a bit misleading. The veranda is just the landing area outside the door with a table and chair. It did open up to a very pretty grassy courtyard.LocationSituated in beautiful La Jolla in walking distance to the beach. We walked over to the glider launch area and down an amazing hike to Black's Beach! It's very steep and not for the faint of heart. The beach is popular in the nudist community so fair warning!Biggest ComplaintExtremely challenging to navigate the property. There did not seem to be an obvious simple or quick way to get to the pool/spa area and our parking spot. The different levels was confusing too. We ran into at least two other guests who were wandering around lost and trying to study the little property map at the same time. I think we even walked the perimeter through the parking lot once because it was just easier than trying to find our way through all the corridors. Recommend MORE DIRECTIONAL SIGNAGE. Maybe with accompanying maps that show context of where the guest is in relation to everything else like you are here arrow.All in all, I would definitely book this place and spa again. So relaxing -- wonderful getaway.Thank you for your review! We apologize if the property is confusing with 6 acres of land we can understand your frustration! We do, however, appreciate the time you took to provide your comments and feedback. Your attention to detail is truly outstanding! We hope to see you again soon, and look forward to your return. Congratulations on your little one on the way, and we hope to meet him or her some day too!
1166	3	We stayed here because my husband had a meeting that was being held at this hotel. I had great expectations based on reviews I read on trip advisor and the beautiful pictures on the website. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. It is a fine hotel. As I said in the title it's serviceable. Maybe my standards are too high but I felt there were certain things lacking that you would expect at a top notch hotel. We checked in late at night and the place was deserted. We waited at the front desk for a few minutes and then ran into someone sweeping the floor who then went to find someone to check us in. It was odd. We finally got to our room and I say finally because the hotel is laid out in such a way as to be somewhat confusing until you figure out what's going on. So it took us awhile to get to the room. We were on the 3rd floor but there was no elevator so we had to make several trips to get to the room with our luggage. I would hope that there is an easier way if you are incapable of stairs and luggage but it wasn't readily accessible to us. The hallways look dated and we commented on how outside almost every room were champagne glasses. I assume people were done with them and put them outside the rooms for pickup but why they were there at midnight was beyond me and I'm talking the majority of rooms. We had to make sure not to knock into them with our luggage and shatter glasses. This was a daily occurrence. We certainly didn't get champagne so not sure what that was about. On the plus side the bed was very comfortable and the sheets were clean. However, the pillowcases were too short for the pillows so they hang out (quirk of mine but I hate that in a hotel). I like the pillow to be completely covered. The towels were incredibly soft but very small. Again, another quirk but I think in a nice hotel there should be large towels and more than just two per day. There was one bar of soap to wash hands with and we like to have one for the shower instead of the bath gel. So asked two days in a row to please have an extra bar of soap. By day three we actually received them. The grounds are beautiful with lots of places to sit, but none of the sitting areas were actually comfortable. Some comfortable sitting areas would be welcome. Lastly, we had easter brunch at the Mustang and burros restaurant as we were meeting family from LA. They drove down for this 70 per person brunch. The brunch was fine but in no way merited 70 per person. Had a hard time getting refills on coffee. Never got offered any other drinks, asked for bowls but never came. Just kind of disorganized and the seating outside is awkward because the tables are low and the chairs are high and you are sort of hunched over. I hate that this sounds like a complaining review because I usually don't like to do that but I just felt annoyed that I flew to San Diego which is a 4 hour flight for me, to keep my husband company at his meeting and in hopes of having a relaxing stay at a beautiful hotel and just felt it was not worth the time and money it took to get there.Dear Vicki000,Thank you for choosing to stay at Estancia while your husband was at our resort on business. It was a pleasure to have you as a guest and we're pleased that you enjoyed the beautiful grounds and comfortable accommodations. We do apologize, however, that certain aspects of your stay with us did not meet your expectations. We value your feedback and have shared your comments with the appropriate management teams. We do hope to welcome you back to Estancia in the future for a stay that surpasses all of your expectations.
1167	4	We have stayed at the Estancia several times we always have a good time enjoy the ambiance of the property. This time, weekend before Christmas was exceptionally quiet we took advantage of that because we've been there w/ one or two weddings or a jazz concert on their large main courtyard it gets very busy, crowded noisy!The grounds are very pretty, the large pool area very inviting heated! w/ a decent sized spa adjacent plus facilities. The resort sits on 9 plus acres, so you can manage to find manicured nooks, some w/ fireplaces to enjoy that quiet time. . Adjacent to the resort on a nice walk is the Salk Institute next to that the Gliderport. Something to see if u enjoy watching gliders along the beautiful coastline! Keep in mind this resort is not in the busy w/ tight parking La Jolla downtown area, its more of a relax get away stay put kinda place at least for us:)If you want right on the coast but in downtown La Jolla I would also consider the Pantai Inn.The rooms we have had are the standard w/ King although not very large they are comfortable well decorated. Small fridge available (used to be the locked booze bar). The bathrooms are also spacious w/ tub shower all amenities. There is a security safe for your valuables good coffee tea by a nook in the entryway available. On this outing we had a balcony but it only had room for one seat to enjoy the smaller court yard below.The But comes with our experience w/ Mustangs Burros their restaurant/bar w/ a beautiful large stone/brick fireplace seating area. Since TripAdvisor doesn't want reviewers to talk about restaurants on the Hotel review portion I will cover that on my separate review.Suffice it to say one gripe that ties in to the Resort policy is that we called to make reservations asked if we can bring our wine bottle provided by the resort (included in your resort fee).The answer was of course, yet when we got there the first thing the hostess said was you cant drink your bottle here! It went south from there:(The staff did a good job to be polite attentive I expected that on a very slow weekend.Be aware that there is a separate Valet only parking fee besides the Resort fee, but expectthat all along the CA coast resorts. In light of our issue w/ the MB restaurant/bar I would recommend visiting the Estancia, and I hope they review/revise their policy on that!Its such a pleasure to read such a positive review from a recurring quest! We are so happy that you enjoyed the resorts ambience, pool area, and most importantly the service. We are so appreciative that we have the opportunity to apologize for the miscommunication at Mustangs Burros and will be certain to look into the matter to prevent a mix-up such as this from happening in the future. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We hope we are able to welcome you back again soon!
1168	5	Estancia was perfect for a girls weekend (bachelorette party). Brett the concierge called the day prior to check on the reservation, and also worked diligently to get our group of rooms together. The grounds are beautiful and the rooms are very nice- especially the FRESH brand products in the bathroom!The highlight of the trip was the service we received at the pool. We rented 2 day beds for the day and Himiko was amazing. She was always checking in on us and provided fast and accurate service (our many drink orders were always right!).Dear RaRaP123456, We're delighted to hear that you and your friends had a great girls weekend at Estancia La Jolla. We're especially pleased to know that Brett and Himiko helped make your celebration special. We appreciate your feedback and hope to welcome you back soon for another La Jolla getaway.
1169	3	Clean little place, friendly staff, but VERY limited parking. Website only states 20 for self-park, but didn't mention that there was only 6 or 7 parking spaces, and they sell out quickly. Parking on the street is free, but 2 hour limit. We found a parking lot a couple blocks away that charged 40 for overnight. The room itself was clean, functional (our bargain room had a kitchen and full fridge - bonus!).The price was affordable. I would stay here again for sure! Thanks for the review. Sorry to hear about your parking experience. We do say in the confirmations to call in to reserve parking ahead of time. There is about 17 free street parking spots outside of the hotel. I wish we could of helped you get a spot. Glad you found the room clean and found value in your stay. We look forward to having you back!!Warm Regards,Justin
1170	4	Our room was very clean, much cleaner than most places we've stayed.. It was smaller than we expected for the price. There were not enough electrical outlets available to charge our phones and iPad. I had to move a piece of furniture to get a free outlet. The outlets built into the lamps seem to go dead when the lamp... More
1171	5	Wonderful Place to stay, People very friendly and helpful, it was clean well taken care of, Breakfast and pool was Great. Close to places you would want to see in New Orleans and the French Quarter. Close to Bourbon, Canal Streets, Bus Stop right there, Park across the street.
1172	5	This hotel was lovely. I am very observant to everything that goes on around me. If I see something I do not like, I keep it to myself. I did not see anything at all wrong with this hotel. The location was fantastic!! The service was the best I've ever encountered in traveling. If there are any complaints at all about this hotel...it's probably from miserable people who hate their lives.
1173	5	My sister and I spent several nights here and we were very happy here. It's very close to the French Quarter - just on the edge of it, I'd say. The room we had was very comfortable - a bit small, but it was pretty, clean, quiet and very nice. The front desk was very helpful and breakfast was great. All in all a great experience and I would recommend this place to anyone. Considering what a good location it is, the rate was surprisingly reasonable which we really appreciated.Thank you guest for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate your business and the recommendation. We hope you will come back and stay again soon.
1174	5	The Hotel staff we're incredibly friendly and welcoming. They took care of things for me before I even asked. The breakfast was good with eggs bacon or sausage, a waffle maker, yogurt muffins bagels Etc. The courtyard was nice although it was too cold to swim in the pool in November. Room was clean except for one day when a cleaner left a bag of towels in our room. The location was nice because it was just a few minute walk Into the heart of the French Quarter but far enough away to avoid the noise. Just across the street from Louis Armstrong Park which was also a beautiful place to be.I am pleased to hear you enjoyed our hotel and staff. You are right it was a bit chilly this weekend. I hope the next time you are in New Orleans you will come back and see us. Sincerely, Chastity
1175	5	I recommend this hotel , excellent facilities, very helpful and friendly staff, clean and very comfortable. We had a room overlooking courtyard, great view and excellent room.Location is excellent weather you are walking or taking local transport. Local Tram/Buses and Hop on Off Services very close to Hotel.There is parking which we did not use.Terry Thank you for your outstanding reveiw!We are uniquely perfect in our location - close to everything yet quiet for a good night's sleep.Thanks again for recommending us to everyone on TripAdvisor - we will look forward to your return.Kind Regards,Stanley Mascair, CHA
1176	5	My husband and I loved the charm of this place , nice center courtyard,with pool and fountain, comfortable room with lovely comfy bed , nice shower -lots of hot water. The buffet type breakfast every morning was super. Eggs and sausage or bacon , toast,bagels,waffles,yogurt and fruit cups, very nice . The personnel were friendly and helpful. far from the noise of Bourbon Street but close enough to walk to farmers market,waterfront activities,shopping and Bourbon St. Try French Man St. for more local music and food. We stayed 3 days before a 7 day Caribbean cruise. Found it a lot of fun.
1177	4	A small group of us stayed here for a 3 night stay. The rooms were clean, the hotel was good, the breakfast above average. Parking was available but get in early as they fill up, and it's free parking. Good value, I will stay here again.Thank yo D-Butel for taking the time to review our hotel. We look forward to your next stay!
1178	2	The hotel itself is fine but two times the housekeeping staff left our door open so when we came back after long days out we found the room wide open. The safe was not accessible so our passports and valuables were left unsecured. Having left the door open we would have thought they would have been in there replacing towels or making beds but neither of those things were done. We spoke with management and received an apology but we're not offered any compensation. Disappointing. Thank you for choosing Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel for your stay during Mardi Gras. I am sorry to hear that we didn't meet all of your expectations. Let me assure you that your issue will be addressed with our housekeeping staff. If you travel to New Orleans in the future, we would love to have another opportunity to meet your expectations.Thank You,Robert K. MOD
1179	3	I stayed here for one night, as planned, on my way back home from another trip. The staff throughout was amazing. The hotel is located in a old building but then again it is at the tip of the french quarter so that should be expected. The room I stayed in was really large with a comfortable king bed, eating table, office desk and chair, credenza and couch. It was outdated in its style but for the price and location, and short stays, this is a really great deal. The bathroom needs to be bleached down but there were more than enough clean towels and counter space with a small coffee maker for the supplied coffee and tea. They also have complimentary continental breakfast. It was too cold to use the terrace but it would be the perfect place for morning coffee and beignets. The location results in a quieter sleep but verify your surroundings before venturing.
1180	5	We stayed at this hotel for four nights on our honeymoon. We had a King suite with Jacuzzi tub, internet included, microwave and refrigerator. We got a great deal and the room was beautiful. The hotel property is well maintained and inviting and the staff is friendly and helpful. The courtyard/pool are lovely.The location was perfect for us. It is only three block from Bourbon Street and the entire French Quarter and Garden District are both within walking distance. The breakfast was great! Sometimes when you hear continental breakfast you think stake doughnuts and bad fruit - this was not the case here. Each day had eggs, breakfast meat and bread or potatoes. In addition fruit, yogurt, toast, bagels, waffles, coffee, juices and water were available. We liked to start our day with breakfast at the hotel while we reviewed our plan for the day. It also helped cut down on our food costs.My only suggestion - if you have a room on the first floor bring a fan. The noise from the courtyard can travel and if you are a light sleeper this might be a problem for you.
1181	1	Steer clear of this hotel, which is really a motel. The walls are paper thin and we never slept due to rowdy people in the courtyard even past midnight. Our room was dirty and high priced. We have never stayed in a worse place.Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We greatly appreciate your business and loyalty to our brand.
1182	4	Paying 25.00 a day for parking seem ridiculous for parking spaces that could not fit a standard size car. Having to park to one side of the parking lane and still having to squeeze out of the car is not acceptable. This was the only disappointment in our stay. The rooms were clean and nice and comfortable with all amenities except for microwave. We wanted to reheat food that we had in the refrigerator but discovered no microwave in the room.Dear Guest, Thank you for writing a review of your stay in New Orleans. I am sorry that the parking fee was an unsatisfactory issue for you. We hope that you will give us another try. I am happy that the rest of your stay was enjoyable.Thank you, Bryant FaulGeneral Manager
1183	5	We were very impressed with this hotel. From the staff to the facilities from the great location within easy walking distance to all the action in the French Quarter to the ambience, this hotel is the place to stay. Cannot recommend it enough! We were also booked at another expensive major chain hotel later that week and frankly that experience paled in comparison to our experience at the Best Western Plus. Don't hesitate to book. We are seasoned and extensive travelers and I rarely give excellent recommendations. We will be back!
1184	5	My wife and I were in town for a concert event. We were really impressed with the staff at this location. When we arrived the clerk advised about walking to the French Quarter from the hotel and the best routes to take, especially after dark. We decided last minute to drive to the concert because of weather concerns. The concert did not end until late and when we returned to the hotel the gate was shut at the entrance. My wife ran in and asked the clerk who came out promptly and opend the gate. The parking was a little tight especially since I drive a large SUV but amazingly I had no problems parking. Overall I could not have been happier with our stay. The price could have been better but that is always the case. I will return to this location in the near future with the rest of my family and have no problems recommending it to friends.
1185	5	We arrived at the hotel hot and tired. The staff was warm and friendly. When they found out we were there to celebrate a special occasion my 50 Birthday they went out of there way to make me feel special. The location of the room overlooked the pool and garden. The room was beautiful, well decorated. The bed was very conferable. I believe the sheets were even a high thread count . I liked the fact that is was only 3 blocks from the excitement Bourbon Street. This made it very convenient for walking. Plan on walking everyplace. There is lots to do and see. Defiantly walk to Cafe Dumont for Cafe Au Lait and a Beignets are a must. Walk along the fresh market for some fine shopping and walk along the Mighty Mississippi and look out over the water. The hotel is close enough to get to the action but far enough away that when it is time to sleep you don't have to deal with the noise. The hotel courtyard and fountain with a nice pool is a great place to be outdoors. Continental breakfast had a great variety of choices including eggs, and a pleasant dining room overlooking the courtyard and pool. Before you leave you must stop by Clover Grill on 900 Bourbon Street for the worlds best breakfast you will ever eat. If you are going to New Orleans and need a place to stay don't hesitate choose this hotel you won't regret it.
1186	3	When we arrived noticed the street was in construction as cable car rails were being installed. Area was away from French quarter but in walking distance. Place shown its age.Plus side receptionist helpful and kind. One elevator- room for two people.Room showed age. But plus side free wi fi, coffee maker in rom , large screen tv and many many channels to choose from. Free breakfast and coffee makerLovely garden in back of propertyThank you for choosing the Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel for your stay in New Orleans. I do apologize for the mess of the construction in front of the hotel. When this is complete it will become an asset for the city and our hotel.I hope that you will consider us for any future stays in New Orleans so we can show you the completed project.Thank you, Robert K. MOD
1187	5	Needed a place to stay for just one night with the family to be fairly close to MSY but also check out the NOLA scene for first time in my life..It was easy to find . The Parking was very accessible whcih seems like a premium in this area . It was on the edge of the of the neighborhood and just a very easy walk to Bourban street ..So it was good to be close but not in an overlly intense environment..perfect for a family to experience the flavor but not get to caught up in the insanity . It was a great experience and would highly recommend this hotel. Staff was great without exception . Room was small..but hey it's the French Quarter and we weren't looking to do aerobics in the room . .Dear Guest, I was glad to hear your stay in New Orleans was enjoyable and that you would recommend our hotel in the future. Thank you for reviewing our hotel.Thank You, Bryant Faul
1188	5	WOW did we have a good time in NOLA. It was our first time to visit this incredible city and our experience was a true delight. From the moment we walked in the door of this hotel, we felt at home. The staff was incredible. Glenn and Robert checked us in and acknowledged our 25th wedding anniversary with an upgrade. Our room (suite) was absolutely lovely, the courtyard is beautiful, the breakfast room, bar area and lobby are quaint. All of the staff at this hotel were pleasant, thoughtful and accommodating We just can't say enough good things about how we were treated and how genuinely nice and sincere everyone was. This hotel should be commended for their superior hospitality, they sure won us over. Room was quiet, breakfast was fine, just a few short blocks to Bourbon.
1189	5	I had no expectations in coming to San Diego. I had visited the city 17 years prior and remembered it being beautiful, but I never made it to Old Town. My one goal for the couple of days we had there was to enjoy some Mexican Food. Well, did we come to the right place or what. The Best Western is situated on the side of the hill with a view of the city and the Pacific. It is like a maze and due to low season there were not a lot of people on the property. It felt like we had the place to ourselves. There is a heated pool and a hot tub which are lovely especially at night. We had two amazing experiences regarding the restaurant Acapulco when we were there. Our first night we arrived after a long day of traveling and we were exhausted and starving. It said in our room book that the restaurant closed at 10pm. I looked at the clock and it was 10:01. I called to ask if there was any chance of getting food. They brought us a HUGE platter of amazing Mexican food and a 6-pack and the total was only 70!!! I was so happy. The next morning for breakfast we went to Acapulco again and were greeted by the very friendly staff. The table next to us had a coupon which they couldn't use for some reason so after they left the waitress applied the coupon to our bill without our knowledge and saved us over 20.00 We were blown away. The room was huge and fit our group of 5 comfortably. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas and they even gave my daughter a lovely Christmas gift from under the tree. It is a one minute walk to the main drag in old town and two minutes to a lovely park up the hill. Also the hotel is very close to the transit system and the State park (which is really cool).Thank you for brining attention to the warm responsive service you received while staying with us. Indeed, Old Town boasts some of the best Mexican fare in all of San Diego. Acapulco is a great choice for any meal we are grateful to have them right on our property. Overall, I am happy that we exceeded your expectations and delighted you with our central location!
1190	5	Beautiful Hotel in a beautiful location. Local to everything that San Diego is known for. The property and the staff help make it a beautiful vacation experience. It is part of Old Town, San Diego, which offers historical sites, shopping and great restaurants. The Hotel is central to all San Diego attractions. It is so quiet and peaceful at night.Thank you! I enjoyed your sentiment, It is so quiet and peaceful at night. This is the type of relaxing and comfortable environment we strive for. And indeed, we are in the heart of Old Town, walking distance to numerous restaurants, museums, parks, unique shops and the train station. We cant wait for you to return!
1191	4	Great location! A short walk to everything in Old Town! Lots of restaurants and shops very close by. Room was clean, but basic--2 tea bags in room! Check-in and check-out was quick and easy!Beds were clean and comfortable. I was disappointed for the price paid that there was no breakfast included, and when we happened to eat breakfast at the restaurant there is was less than adequate. Our breakfast order, which we put out on our door, was not picked up at night so we had the surprise of no breakfast in the room the next morning, but the clerk in reception comped our meal as a result, which was the right thing to do.Thank you for sharing your experiences while with us. Your feedback regarding the mistake we made on your breakfast order is invaluable. I am thankful our leadership team did the right thing, and comped your meal. Based on your overall happiness with your stay, we hope you will give us a chance to welcome you back. If you have any questions regarding breakfast options, feel free to call us before you make your reservation. Thank you again!
1192	4	We came back after a bad experience last year as the manager offered us a discount to try it out again. Overall the staff were friendly except for when we checked in. We went to the lounge after check in and waited over 15 minutes before being acknowledged (while sitting at the bar), and then another 10 minutes before we received a drink. I really wanted to eat there as the food looked amazing last year, but we chose to dine somewhere else. Our hotel room was beside a meeting room that was booked both mornings of our stay so we were woken up at 6:45am both days. Their food beverages were set up outside our window so it was loud and we were not able to sleep in. The hotel itself is beautiful and the hot tub pool area is a lot of fun. The rooms are a bit difficult to locate as there are multiple buildings and levels.
1193	4	We loved visiting San Diego. This Best Western was in a neat location in Old Town. The hotel charged for parking, but we were able to find free parking on the street all three days we were there. The rooms are a bit dated and musty, but the grounds were lovely. We sat outside in the courtyard each morning to have our coffee. :) There are lots of stairs in this place. I would stay here again simply for the location.
1194	5	I travel for business and I stayed at the Best Western Hacienda Hotel and it was great the staff was friendly and professional and the rooms were clean and well decorated and there was easy access to entertainment and food.Were pleased to hear you had a good stay while conducting business in San Diego. We make every effort to expectations of guests so your compliments of the cleanliness of the rooms and friendliness of the team are much welcomed. For business or leisure we offer a variety of conveniences including the exercise room, complimentary breakfast and computers in the lobby for guest use. We also offer a complimentary shuttle to major points around the city.
1195	5	The hotel was very well kept and in a quite and safe area. The hotel is resort style so the propery is several different buildings tied together with courtyards. The outdoor pool area was clean and well kept. The rooms were standard but very nice. The entire property felt very authentic with the local area. Also, having a restaurant right on property was very convienent. All of the local restaurants and shops were easily within walking distance. If we visit San Diego again we will definitely stay here! Thank you for taking time to leave a glowing review of your experience. This is the kind of excellent description that really helps travels planners get a sense of all we offer. Were glad that you enjoyed our vintage California style as well as the cuisine at our rooftop restaurant, Old Town Tequila Factory. For those planning travel on a weekend, Ill mention their excellent Saturday and Sunday brunches! We hope youll get the opportunity to return. Remember to book direct for the best rates and any specials we have going on. Until then - safe travels! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager
1196	3	Located on a hillside overlooking Old Town San Diego, the Best Western Plus Hacienda has charm but has a rather quirky layout. It used to be a shopping center and has several levels and elevators that sometimes don't work. Be prepared to walk lots of stairs especially if you're in Building 6 like we were. I booked a room with a two queens and a sofa sleeper for our family of five but when we got to our room in Building 4 there was no sofa sleeper. We headed back down to the lobby and the front desk clerk asked, Are you sure We had to laugh at that. Another staff member offered to show us two other room choices. She walked us around to the rooms and was very courteous and professional. Our luggage was moved from the old room to the new room in Building 6 quickly and efficiently. The parking area for Building 6 is very small and fills up early in the evening. The parking spaces themselves are impossibly narrow and hard to get out of. The local channels on our TV were awfully static and hard to watch while the cable stations came in clear. But in spite of all that, our room was clean, comfortable and spacious enough for our family. Old Town is a great area to stay in with lots of restaurants, museums and things to explore. Plus it is centrally located...less than 10 - 15 minutes to Downtown, Balboa Park, La Jolla Cove and the Airport. Good stay, great location!Thank you for your recent stay with us and for taking the time to tell us what you thought! I apologize the room didnt have the sofa sleeper as expected, but Im very happy to hear one of our staff members went the extra mile to remedy the situation and get you into a room suited nicely for your family! Please come see us again the next time you are in the area, and until then-- happy travels!
1197	5	From the time you arrive at the front desk your eyes are filled with so much to take in and appreciate to the staff doing everything they can to answer any question you may have and make your stay wonderfull. Then you get to your room and are pleasantly surprised on just how much care and effort was put in to match the location of the old town feel. Great jobExcellent review and comments. We know that any great hospitality experience starts with smiled and in so pleased this carried through to your entire stay. The hotel design was inspired to match the vintage charm of Old Town thank you for noticing the care we put into it. We hope you'll consider our Best Western your home away from home when visiting San Diego. Until next time, happy travels! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager
1198	4	Arrived early rooms wasnt ready, so took a walk around the old town. Very Mexican also very quaint. The hotel its self was very nice, staff help full. Our room was good size with a balcony over looking the pool. Tried the restaurant one night, found the food to be very tasteful. A wonderful waiter whos name I forgot ( sorry ) was very informative about San Diego. Overall a lovely hotel and wound recommended and definitely stay again if ever in San Diego. Thank you for your recent stay at our Best Western. Im happy to hear you took a stroll through Old town while waiting for your room. Did you get a chance to see the Heritage Park or the Whaley (haunted) House next door There is a lot of history here! Ill pass your regards to the team at the Old Town Tequila Factory, our rooftop restaurant. Glad to hear you enjoyed the service there and at the hotel. We strive to offer gracious hospitality and your comments let us know we succeeded. Looking forward to your return and sincerely appreciate the recommendation. Wishing you a colorful autumn season! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager
1199	1	I looked forward to staying at this hotel for so long and I was so disappointed. My room never got cleaned, the young lady at the front desk on Friday was just plain rude when answering questions about the hotel. There were numerous areas of the hotel that needed attention badly. From a distance it looks beautiful, but up close the hotel was just plain dirty and run-down. I fully realize this Best Western because of it's location does a huge volumn of business, which is all the more reason that things should be kept in much better condition. I would love to visit again because the views are wonderful and the beds are comfortable. However, the water running all night as well as the unkept grounds and bad service may cause me to change my mind. I am afront office manager at another BW location and I simply can't believe the things I saw and heard during my visit to this property.
1200	5	The Hacienda Hotel is like a home away from home for me. I travel a lot and my stay here is always exceptional. The Hacienda is a beautiful hotel, the grounds are breathtaking, the area is safe, the hotel rooms are clean, and the staff are very friendly, especially McKenzy. The last time I stayed here my son proposed to his girlfriend by the courtyard fountain. So the Hacienda will always be very special to me!!!What a sweet memory! Thank you for taking the time to share why our hotel is special to you. Ill let McKenzy know she was in your thoughts and her warmth left a lasting impression. For anyone planning a family reunion or group visit, McKenzy is a great person to speak with. We hope you will visit again soon!
1201	4	Needed a cheap place near Atl for the weekend. Good price for a good little room. Nice size tv sink updated. Bathroom could use work as hot and cold water is reversed and hot water doesn't get very hot.
1202	4	From the moment we arrived, all staff were courteous and welcoming. A special shout-out goes to Gene, our complimentary driver who shuttled us to Pricci's- he was so friendly and polite and accommodating. Our room had a beautiful view of downtown, everything was clean and crisp, our air conditioner worked just fine, and Christina and the bartender at happy hour were wonderful. No complaints from these Marriott Rewards members- thank you for a lovely weekend!
1203	5	Spending my Christmas at the hotel (long story) decided to try the rib eye at the hotel restaurant. One of the best I've ever had! Bartender Fally made me feel very welcome as well. Check in was easy and the desk person also made me feel very welcome. Recommend the hotel and definitely recommend the restaurant
1204	1	I have seen this before in other hotel brands but shocked that the JW Marriott has resorted to HVAC manipulation to save a buck. You know where you turn the thermostat to 65 at night and the air blows at 70 (if you're lucky). Actually in our case it was turned down to 60 because we overrode the thermostat and called maintenance when this didn't work and the air still couldn't have been any cooler than 70. The thing about it is that the air was working because the room would cool off in the daytime. Apparently they're overriding the air temp from a master switch and putting a cap on how cool it will be at night. I'm sure this is to conserve electricity but why can't they do this in the daytime when people aren't in their rooms or trying to sleep instead of at night when people actually care about the temperature! Just be aware if you like your room temp below 70 you probably won't be happy here.Dear WullaB86,Thank you for choosing us for your visit. Our team strives to ensure an enriching experience for each guest, and we regret letting you down. It is disheartening to read that we fell short of our standards and we hope you will accept our apologies for the issues you encountered with the temperature of your room. We appreciate your patience, and we look forward to another opportunity to show you our commitment to quality and inspired service.Best Regards,Eb MbyeDirector of Operations
1205	5	This place was fab! Had a wonderful and romantic weekend here on part of our holiday in America. Loved the room and the big nice comfy bed. Would defintely stay here again.
1206	4	The JW is well-located within Buckhead, attached to Lenox Mall which is great for shopping. The amenities provided are comprehensive but the rooms are a bit dated and the other Marriott across the street is quite frankly just as good for about 30 less a night.Overall I would say this hotel is great but nothing impressive or really spectacular here. The service is the only thing I would say that stands out.Thank you for your post. I am glad that you found the hotel convenient and the service levels exceeded your expectations. The JW Marriott Service levels are truly what set us apart from Marriott Hotels, Conference Centers and Resorts. Thank you for your feedback regarding your guest room. We take all comments very seriously for future planning. I hope you will plan to visit again.
1207	4	If shopping is your thing Lenox Mall (or Phipps Plaza across the street), offers some of the best high end shopping in the Southeast. We moved from Atlanta to South Florida twenty years ago. We are very familiar with the area and where looking for a place where our adult children could meet up with us before driving father north for the holidays. There is a Marta Station (Lenox) directly across the street from the hotel. When coming from the Airport make sure to take the train marked Doraville. Parking is expensive 20/day if you do not use the valet. We booked using a general hotel web site hours before our arrival and got and excellent rate. It may be possible to do even better if you call the hotel direct. Like all Marriott hotels the service and accommodations were excellent. We stayed during the holiday week so traffic was light. I like most people still complain about the internet charges. We just used our own data. There are numerous great restaurants within walking distance or a short taxi ride from the hotel. There is a quick breakfast cafe servicing the office crowd in the shared office tower.
1208	4	Fabulously friendly staff working the lobby area. Very willing to engage you in conversation. Nice workout room. However, after a long day in the office arrived to my room at 5pm to find no housekeeping attention. Disappointed that for the price that occurred, as well as no complimentary breakfast and unless you're a rewards member you're charged for wi-fi.
1209	5	When we arrived we were greeted by the staff. They were very friendly and knowledgeable. Our room it was very clean, Everything worked great. The only thing lacking was more condiments for the coffee or tea. We were able to get more from the lobby. Nice pool and spa that worked.Awesome view of the city!
1210	5	I stay at this JW Marriott every time I visit Atlanta, which is several times a year. Whether with my husband or shopping trips with my daughter and granddaughter, I feel special and welcome each time. I cannot say enough about the front desk staff. They see to your every need, greeting you by name each time you walk through the door.They make you feel very much at home! The rooms are amazing, always clean and up to date. I love the concierge lounge- the breakfast and evening horderves are excellent and the staff is so kind. Thank you everyone for making each visit to this Marriott one of a kind!Thank you for sharing your JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead experience. I am glad we were able to make you feel special during your visit and that you were home-away-from-home. I'll share you wonderful comments with our team. Looking forward to your next visit.
1211	5	Fantastic hotel. Staff was very friendly. Good food served at our conference. Excellent location. Concierge gave us a lunch recommendation that was so good we went back for dinner the same night. I would put this hotel right up there with the Ritz around the corner.
1212	4	Marriott Platinum. The people at the JW Marriott Buckhead are great. From the front desk, room service delivery, lounge staff, to the other people we interacted with the customer service is great. The rooms and lounge however feel dated. The rooms are clean and spacious but it reminded me of the late 90s/early 2000s. The lounge is also smaller than expected and the food options are OK but they run out quick! Overall, the stay was above average with the staff being the stars. I would stay here again, but would like to see a facelift.Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your visit. I am glad you found our staff accommodating and they provided you with great customer service. I wanted to share that within the past week we have replaced our lobby and Nox Creek Lounge carpet and next summer, our Grand Ballroom will be re-invented. I am glad you will be visiting again.
1213	3	Been to this JW Marriott many times. They did a nice remodel and the staff are friendly, HOWEVER this time, we booked a room for THREE and received an upgrade to a larger room but with only ONE bed and a pullout couch. The couch was not comfortable for our 12 year old. The corner room smelled very musty, there was not enough towels for three either. Frustrating when you are a marriott member, they have your profile, you book a room for three and they can't even have enough towels and only one housecoat. Very disappointed this time!I would like to sincerely apologize for the disappointment in your recent visit. I have personally followed up with our team to address the service and housekeeping issues you have shared. Our engineering team is also checking the sensors and air conditioning in our corner rooms. Thank you for letting us know. We do appreciate your loyalty and the nice comments regarding our staff and remodel. I hope you will give us the opportunity to regain your confidence and visit again.
1214	3	I'd like to preface by stating it's a 3.5. I booked a club room via Anerican Express platinum. We were upgraded to a deluxe room, nice. The club is definitely not worth it! Any club I've been in has more than 2 offerings a day. And definitely more than 1 on the weekends! Very disappointed. You can not go into the club and just grab a water or soda. It is locked many hours of the day on weekends. Rooms were average. Lobby average. Housekeeping did a very nice job. Just not impressed:(Thank you for staying with us and for letting us know your thoughts on our Executive Lounge. I am sorry for your disappointment. We will definitely take your comments into consideration for any future changes to our Executive Lounge hours. I am glad you enjoyed your upgraded room and found our housekeeping team did a nice job. I do also hope that you will consider a future stay with us. We would love to have you return.
1215	1	Arrived after a long trip. Got to the hotel after 11pm and discovered that even though I had a guaranteed reservation, there was no room waiting for me because they had overbooked the hotel. They walked me to a Fairfield hotel about 8 miles away (great staff but a tad nasty and very worn hotel). I wasn't the only one walked. At least four or five other people had the same experience I did at the same time (and according to the Fairfield clerk--a lot of people have this happen). Maybe this was a lucky break. When I took the Fairfield van back to the Marriott in the early morning for a meeting I had there I discovered, according to one guest, that he had experiencced strange bugs (bedbugs) in his room that night.....so perhaps a golden lining.
1216	4	We couldn't book our usual Ritz, so went here instead. Glad it was discounted, as the rooms are tired and awkward, can't really see TV from the bed, nowhere to put clothes, the inroom refrigerator clanked and clattered all night. That said, the location cannot be beat and the staff is WONDERFUL. Beds are comfy and room is roomy. The staff makes the place, so this will be my 2nd choice when in the area.
1217	4	Good location in the heart of Buckhead. No real views from the rooms. Mine looked at the parking garage. Beds were comfortable and the staff friendly. I ordered breakfast from the hang tag menu. Got a call in the am that they didn't have the cereal I wanted. I just had them deliver me coffee and a banana. Of course I got a pot of coffee with no cream or sugar. And they ended up charging me for it. A call to request the charge be removed took care of the issue, which was very helpful.
1218	5	The wife and I, along with 2 other couples stayed at the JW Marriott this past week on the Wine Down Weekend Package. The stay was outstanding. From valet, check-in, porter, restaurant staff, to the concierge the staff could not have been friendlier or more willing to go out of their way to be helpful. Except for the fact that the rooms do not have a refrigerator they were very perfect, with the most comfortable bedding we ever had in a hotel.All in all an excellent stay that would have been perfect if they could just get the billing issues straighten out.
1219	4	The number one advantage of this hotel is the location. The fact that you can take MARTA from the airport, walk out of the Lenox station and be at the hotel is amazing. I used the convenient car service to get around the Buckhead area to where I was working. My favorite restaurant, Houston's, is conveniently across the street. It's also connected to Lenox Square, so it's perfect for finding the perfect gift for family at home. The staff was very friendly. When I arrived, they acknowledged by Gold status and upgraded me to a larger room on the Concierge level. The breakfast in the Concierge lounge was excellent, as was the service by the staff. The room was tastefully decorated, but a little bit too traditional for my taste. The bathroom was nice, but needs an upgrade. The bed was awesome, clean, and very comfortable.If I can get the same rate at this hotel again, I will definitely stay here again.
1220	5	My husband and I stayed here on a staycation. The hotel is new, clean, and trendy. It is located in Buckhead, and is conveniently attached to Lenox Mall. There are some great food options and a nearby movie theatre in Phipps Mall. And there is generally great shopping in the area. We ended up going out one night and then ordering room service the next night. I would highly recommend if you want to spend a day holed up. The beds were very comfortable.
1221	4	Stayed here on business and staff went out of their way to be service oriented. Room was in nice shape and staff took pride in serving guests. Made use of car rental facility in the hotel which was far more convenient than renting at the airport. Will certainly be back when I am in the area. Thank you for your post. I am delighted you found the hotel comfortable and to learn that you found our staff to be service oriented. I hope that we exceeded your expectations. The rental car kiosk located in the hotel is indeed a nice convenience and I am happy you were able to utilize this to service. Hope to see you again soon.
1222	5	This location is attached to the Lenox Square Mall in Buckhead, so easy access to lots of restaurants, shopping, and my downtown clients. It's reasonably priced and has full services--coffee bar, restaurant, room service, and pantry with snacks/beverages just off the front desk.But what earned 5 stars from me was the incredible service. Southern hospitality is one thing these folks raise it by an order of magnitude. A few examples: My colleagues and I had access to the club lounge for breakfast, and arrived half an hour before it was over. The urn of coffee was running out--so the concierge ran downstairs and brought us Starbucks. (They also have a self-serve espresso-based drink machine.) There are also a cadre of very nice gentlemen working the door to help with baggage and transportation. One day I walked in and the gentleman with a luggage cart jokingly offered me a ride--staff with a sense of humor! And the day I left, a staff gentleman in the hall saw me with my bag and was genuinely interested in how my stay was (not the kind of rote mumbling question that desk attendants everywhere have to ask). Net net, I felt like all of the team here really cared about me having a great stay. I'll be back.Dear Mary M,It was a pleasure welcoming you to JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead. Thank you for mentioning how much you enjoyed our inspired and tailored hospitality. Our attentive and knowledgeable staff work hard to ensure our guest's expectations are exceeded throughout their stay. Thank you for choosing us for your visit to our beautiful city, and we hope to see you again soon.Best Regards,Eb MbyeDirector of Operations
1223	4	I chose this hotel because I'm loyal to Hilton and have status, plus it was an ideal location for my needs. I paid an average of 100/king for three nights on a holiday weekend which isn't bad for an HGI in this area. The room...More

1225	5	This hotel was very clean and the staff were friendly. The hotel served a different breakfast course each day to accompany their regular daily meals so you could have variety. The pool was crystal clear and the beds were comfortable. Great Place to Stay!I appreciate you taking time to review your stay with us here at the Best Western Mission Bay. I am happy to know you had a great stay and were happy with our rooms and comfortable beds. I appreciate your compliments to our pool, I will pass your comments to our maintenance team.

1226	4	We arrived on an early flight and wanted to drop our bags at the hotel--they were able to check us in at 11:00am. That was a great start to our stay. The room and breakfast were standard Best Western fare. The location was perfect for our three days in San Diego. The hotel is just off I-5 and less than 20 minutes to Coronado, La Jolla, Old Town, etc. I have to mention Irma who ran the breakfast room. She was pleasant, kept things full, and checked in with every guest. Great service!
1227	5	Prime location - kids loved it - free breakfast is always great! My kids and I went to California for a Karate Tournament and this hotel was a great location to everything - we went to the beach, whale watching and his tournament and the hotel was in a perfect location - we will be staying at this hotel next time we visit CA!Good Afternoon,I appreciate you taking time to express your thoughts on your stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay. I am so happy that our location was near your kids karate tournament locations and you were happy with our property, staff and breakfast.

You can reach me directly at 619-275-5700 ext 393 or Lpradohotelpros.bizWe look forward to your return,Leidy PradoFront Office Manager
1228	2	I always rely on TA before booking a hotel but I didn't on this hotel - that was a huge mistake.The location of the hotel was convenient to all locations we wanted to visit but the place needs to be torn down and rebuilt. It is old, dingy, and dark. The room was very dated and had a very dark appearance although there was a front window. The outside walkway, as mentioned by another traveler, is slanted and uneven. The elevator is scary. The breakfast room looks like it used to be a sleeping room and is very dated and dark. The food is typical continental breakfast food. Overall, I would say spend more money and stay somewhere else.Good Morning,Thank you for sharing your review regarding your recent stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. I sincerely appreciate your compliments to our location, just within minutes to most attractions here in San Diego. I apologize for the outside look of our property. Unfortunately, the property next door to ours was just demolished, giving our area a run-down look.

1229	3	Nice motel with Spanish decor. What I like the best was the people that worked there. Always friendly and helpful. What I liked the least was the bathroom. Small. Need updates.

1230	5	Very professional staff who neither try too hard to build rapport, nor come off as too aloof. They get right down to business and make your comfort their first endeavor. I called ahead of time and made sure my reservation was still confirmed. When i got there, they immediately know who I was and had me checked in right away. The room was clean, without a hair out of place. All the appliances worked perfectly, and the room was definitely spacious enough, with a cushy bed and NON SMOKING (Thank you!). Breakfast was delicious, and they made sure to keep all the good stuff stocked throughout the ENTIRE breakfast. Thank you, Best Western, we shall meet again!Good Morning,Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us.I sincerely appreciate all your wonderful compliments to our property and staff.

1232	3	I booked this hotel based on the great reviews it got, and that people seemed to feel like it was in a 'great location'. After staying one night, I have to disagree. I suppose if you are staying and you have a car, it probably is a good location because it's really close to the highway- but we only stayed one night, so we didn't have a car, and the location was terrible. There was nothing to do near the hotel, I am not from the area, so it was hard for me to tell if this is a 'good area' or not, but I was not about to walk around alone. Our hotel room was clean and comfortable, but we only had one working outlet in the room. All of the other outlets were a major fire hazard as they only allowed the plugs to go in half-way. Breakfast was fine, but crowded and I couldn't get the wifi to work. As we were checking out, we watched a mouse swimming around in the pool. With all the being said- every single hotel employee that I spoke with was extremely kind and helpful. They are definitely doing customer service the right way!
1233	1	Room needed some work, or a deep cleaning. It smelled like someone tried to cover a moldy smell with air freshener that smelled like cologne. Though the bed was comfortable, the sheets were dirty on one of the beds, as if someone had walked across it with shoes on. The room had a mini fridge but it was turned down to 1 so I had to turn it on to store my food items. I was given room 115, which unfortunately for me was right near the breakfast area so as soon as breakfast was available I was woken up by everyone walking by and holding loud conversations. Then at 7:45am, what I can only assume was a dance troop staying there, started practicing their routines in the middle of the parking lot while blasting their music and yelling. At 9am when I went to check out they were still going strong and oblivious to anyone trying to navigate the lot. When I was trying to back up, one of them walked up behind my vehicle and I had to ask them to move. Then after pulling out of my spot and attempting to leave, a few of them almost walked right in front of me because they were not paying attention. I find it extremely RUDE that they assumed everyone would be wide awake and want to listen to this. I also find it RUDE that the hotel manager did not go out there and ask them to stop because it may be disturbing other guests. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.
1234	5	Rooms were clean, spacious, incredible breakfast buffet included. Ask front desk for great tips of where to eat! Easy access to highways. Staff very friendly. Don't miss a leisurely walk in the neighborhood to enjoy the landscaping.Thank you. We appreciate the feedback
1235	3	We were in San Diego for one night visiting friends. I knew we wouldn't be in the room much so we didn't care about having a nice pool, view, etc. we just needed a clean place to sleep and that's what we got. I was a bit concerned because the hotel was either full or close to it and was quite noisy. We were in the room next to the ice machine which was really loud. By the time we got back from our evening out, about 10pm, all was quiet and we got a good night sleep. The room was nothing special but clean and suited our needs. The tv remote only worked by pushing the numbers for the channels but we survived. Breakfast is included.Thank you for taking the time to write a review.I am very glad to see that you enjoyed your stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay and were happy with the cleanliness of your room. Do you have any suggestions for ways we can improvePlease let me know when you return to San Diego, as I would be happy to assist you with reservations.

1237	4	This is a very nice motel near the park at Mission Bay, and just up the street, there are restaurants and some shopping. It is not with a lot of other development, as far as shopping malls or tourist endeavors, but right near I-5 and easy access to points of interest from there. It is a clean, quiet motel with pretty much everything you need. It also has a nice breakfast. It doesn't look spectacular from outside (not bad, just not fab), but it is clean and more than adequate.Good Afternoon,Thank you so much for taking the time to review our hotel. I'm so glad to hear you had an excellent stay! We do our best to provide you with excellent service, and your feedback is greatly appreciated.If we can be of assistance in the future, please don't hesitate to contact us anytime at 619.275.5700.

1239	4	The service was great. My room was clean and comfortable. I felt it was a safe area and was very convenient to the I5 freeway, easy to get on and off. I de-magnetized my room keys twice by storing my cell phone next to my key. The desk staff was very helpful and gave me new keys right away and, as I was traveling alone, made sure I got safely into my room. The breakfast was decent w/fresh fruit, yogurt, pasteries, cereals, condiments, waffle maker, boiled eggs and hot items. Juices and hot beverages were also available.
1240	4	I stayed here one night for a business trip. It was in a very convenient place, right of the 5 across from Mission Bay. It's an older hotel with outside doors. The staff is super nice!

1262	2	Great are to walk for shopping and food. Price is reason and under 150 which is my work budget. One visit I walk up to a palmetto bug on my sink. I called the desk and they sent security to kill it. This visit the shears on the window were visibly ripped, but still up.Parking is free and easy, and from a sign in the lobby they will be updating soon.Fitness closet room has two treadmills and on elliptical.Dear Andrea G., Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience at the Fairfield Inn Suites Atlanta Buckhead with us. As the cleanliness of our hotel is one of our key priorities, I am very sorry that your guestroom fell short of your expectations. Please rest assured that your comments have been shared with the housekeeping team in an effort to improve our service. After renovations my team and I would love it if you would come back and visit us again so that we make it up to you. As a valued customer we hope you choose to stay with us whenever your travels bring you back to Atlanta. Sincerely,Damar GrayFront Desk SupervisorFAIRFIELD INN SUITES BUCKHEAD(404) 846-0900
1263	5	This hotel surprised me. It was quite clean, and it was apparent that it had been renovated more recently than Marriott reported. The staff was very helpful. Very nice, clean indoor pool. Security guards in parking lot over the weekend.Thank you so much for your review, we are very pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us. We received several updates last summer, including paint, carpet, wall vinyl and new desk chairs. We did not perform a full renovation which is why the Marriott site will still show our last renovation in 2006. We encourage everyone to come and be suprised by the Fairfield Inn Suites Atlanta Buckhead, you'll be glad you did!
1264	4	My husband and I and our infant and child stayed here to break up a trip while driving home to Florida from Missouri.Room:Cleanliness- the room was overall clean and felt fresh.The bathroom was clean but I noticed a small human body hair on the neatly folded washcloths. I prayed it was a beard hair. The tub seemed a little worn and I didn't want to bathe my infant in it. The shower was extra hot and enjoyable. The beds are by far the best I've slept in. If you've ever enjoyed a Marriott bed you know what I'm talking about!There were ample pillows and the linens were nice. I'm not certain on the detergent used but it made my son and I break out on our faces.I felt the bathrooms could be updated. I stayed at a Marriott in Winnipeg and loved the design. These bathrooms felt cheap. The vinyl feeling walls were cracked and chipped and bubbled and the paint was off. I felt they only provided bare minimum toiletries. Parking was easy for us, which was a plus.The staff was very very kind! I felt welcomed.The breakfast was really good and left me wanting hot oatmeal with all the toppings each morning after I left! Delicious spread! I would recommend some sort of iced tea or cold offering other than juice.Other than the sub par bathroom, I liked this Fairfield. The woman who checked us out was a Denver Broncos fan like us and was SO friendly. I wanted to have coffee with her she was so kind!Dear Kaylee, Thank you for sharing your experience at the Fairfield Inn Suites Atlanta Buckhead through TripAdvisor.With a mission to provide superior customer service, we take great pride in serving your needs and are delighted to hear that we have met your expectations. As a valued customer, your feedback will be shared with the team to continue to inspire and motivate them to deliver exceptional customer service. I will also get in contact with housekeeping and make sure that stay on top of what you have experiences so it will not happen in your future stay. We would love for you come back out and choose us as your lodging needs especially after renovations in January and here your feed back again.

1265	5	The Pearl is a first rate little hotel at which the staff and management obviously care about what they do. They kindly allowed me to stash a piece of luggage there two weeks in advance of my stay and they had it waiting for me in my room upon my arrival. Check in took all of two minutes and the host was friendly and efficient. Both the wake up call and taxi I asked for were expedited without worry. The room was large enough, spotless and had a warm charm with a comfortable bed. The plumbing and shower pressure were excellent. I can't comment as to whether it was noisy since I was tired enough to have slept through anything. I got a bite to eat at the bar and the food was tasty and served up by a helpful and polite barman. If you stay at the Pearl you won't be disappointed but be aware that you'll be charged for the boxes of water you drink that are provided in your room.Thank you very, very much for your great review. We are so honored that you chose The Pearl. Words cannot express our gratitude. Look forward to seeing you in the near future! Make it a great day.
1266	4	Having visited San Diego before and not necessarily enjoying the Gas Lamp District (with it's chain restaurants and conference going visitors), I was excited to discover the hip Pearl Hotel in Point Lomo. When you tally up it's affordable price, friendly customer service, inviting bar and pool area, and overall design, it's clear you have an excellent choice when staying in San Diego.The hotel is a short five minute drive from San Diego Airport, about fifteen minutes to downtown or Balboa Park, and conveniently located next to a Starbucks, grocery store, and the harbor on Shelter Island. Limited on-site parking is available for a reasonable 10 a night although it's probably best to ask the hotel to reserve a spot for you.The hotel itself is a converted motel with just over 20 rooms situated around a small pool. The main check-in area and bar feature a hip lobby and modern looking bar which also serves as a place to grab a bite to eat in the evening and a cup of coffee in the morning.The rooms while retaining that mid-century motel layout are remodeled with clean bathrooms, a comfortable bed, and a trendy design. A nice twist is that each room features a goldfish which adds a nice human touch. Our first floor room let in a little more noise than I expected from the common areas, but by midnight when staff were tidying up and closing the bar, there was little noise to keep you up.While we did run into an issue during our stay, the staff were extremely helpful and pro-active in making sure we left on a good foot. Had they stopped there, I would still have written a positive review but their follow up call and gesture proves that this is a well managed hotel that truly cares about their customers.On behalf of the entire Pearl management and staff, thank you for taking the time to leave a kind and detailed review! We truly appreciate it. Your support means the world to us. Please come visit us again soon. Tell a friend.
1267	5	Just got back from SD and five nights at the Pearl. Kimberly Parker and her staff did a terrific job in taking care of all of our needs and making us feel very welcomed! We travel often and have never received hospitality such as this. The property is retro, comfortable and well cared for. The restaurant is outstanding and the drinks are unique and excellent. Our next visit to SD will involve another visit to the Pearl, and all around great experience!Greatly appreciate you taking time to write a review. Glad you had a great stay with us. Please come visit again soon!!!! Going to share your review with our team. Our restaurant is amazing, glad you got a chance to enjoy it. Tell a Friend.
1268	5	You walk back into the 60's decor. From the moment we arrived the clerk was helpful. The room was very clean and it was nice to be greeted by Pluto, the bedroom mascot. I do not hesitate to recommend.First and foremost Pluto sends his love! Thank you for taking the time to leave a great review. Glad to hear you got the Pearl service you deserve! Hope to have you back soon!
1269	4	I love everything about The Pearl Hotel and Restaurant! I booked the Essentials package, that came with free parking for your stay, two complimentary cocktails, and one appetizer. I stayed in Room 3 and everything was great! The bed was super comfortable and I had a wonderful nights sleep. The room comes with a small patio area, which in my opinion is just ok. I think it could be a little bigger and more private, but if your not going to use it then it shouldn't be a big deal to you. At the Restaurant, the bartender was awesome! He knows what he's doing and is willing to help you out. A+ for the serivce he gave. I think his name might of been John Don't quote me on that though! lol The ONLY things that I think could be improved would be the bathroom, carpeting, and mosquito problem. The carpeting in the room was almost rope like in feeling so I wore sandals when I walked around. The bathroom was not disgusting but it did look run down. There was also this strange occurance of several small mosquitos I caught flying in the room. I think they might be coming from the plants. Those problems are small and the rest of the experience was so great , I was able to overlook the little things. Don't get me wrong, I am super picky when it comes to hotels! I highly reccommend staying here. For people who are constant complainers (you know who you are) don't stay here if you want a nice quiet getaway, there is a Hilton down the way for you.thanks for the GREAT REVIEW!!!!! Super cool. Appreciate it. John is awesome. will let him know. Our staff truly goes the extra mile to create that guest experience. so glad you enjoyed it. your note about the bathroom is well taken and we are addressing it in the near future. hope you come stay with us again soon.
1270	5	This is a very delayed review as it was 6 months ago this week that we stayed at the Pearl Hotel. Ive never felt the urge to write a review of a hotel before, but I really wanted to for this hotel as I was so pleased we found this little gem wanted to share our experience with others thinking of staying here. 7 of us Brits (age ranges between 30 62) arrived at the Pearl late on a Sunday night in November 2010 after driving from Las Vegas. The service we received at check in was great, we were advised on where to park our car (if you park on the street round the corner, its free as opposed to paying for parking outside) were shown to our rooms. It was nearly midnight when we got our luggage out of the car into our room when we discovered a (very minor) issue with our room. We werent going to mention it to reception but thought we would bring it to their attention. Without going into lots of detail (as it would be boring!), we received the best service over our 4 day stay we have ever had on our many trips to the US from this hotel. The reception staff were fantastic in helping to resolve our problem they went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay at the Pearl. You can tell this isnt a chain restaurant is a family run hotel as the little touches made a big difference to our stay. For example, they leave a note after cleaning your room each day telling you what the next days weather will be the menu for that evenings dinner at the restaurant. We were very fortunate to be offered a free meal at the hotel, to be totally honest we were hesitant at eating in the restaurant as we like to explore the local area rather than eat at our hotel for dinner. We were very pleasantly pleased at how yummy the food was, both my husband I had the burger loved it they arent lying when they claim it to be the best burger in the area! We were only disappointed that we left it till our last night to eat there as we would have had more food there had we ate there earlier. We ate in the outside little garden terrace although it was a chilly November night, it has several garden heaters that made it a nice cosy area to eat drink in. Before we headed out for the evenings, we had a few drinks in the bar the beer drinkers in our party were impressed at the wide array of lagers ales on offer. I had a lavender cocktail that I remember being very tasty indeed. There is a good seating area around the pool / cinema screen to enjoy drinks from the bar.With regards to the room, each one has its own fish tank on the wall which is something Id never seen before in a hotel I loved this detail. Between us we had 4 rooms so I got to see all rooms all were of good standard.The location is pretty good, we drove to SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo Old Town none of which took that long to get to. For the evenings that we went out into San Diego, the hotel rang up for a taxi it didnt take long to reach our destination. Overall, I would rate this hotel very highly if you are thinking about booking this hotel I recommend that you do as you wont regret it. 6 months on, all 7 of us who went on the trip adored this hotel we still talk about our stay there it was a real highlight of our 2 week stay to Las Vegas, San Diego, Anaheim LA. If we ever go back to San Diego, I will make sure we stay at this hotel if anyone who works at the hotel is reading this thank you very much for the fabulous service!Thank you very much for the detailed review. Awesome!!!!! The entire staff at the Pearl was honored to have you as our guest. Your kind words are so appreciated. hope you will come stay with us again in the future. Again thank you for choosing the Pearl Hotel.
1271	4	I really liked this place but my wife was a bit tepid on it. In our opinion, there were lots of upside. First of all, affordable. We stayed in room no. 9 which was a junior suite. Great, vintage couch. Goldfish named Bruce Lee on the wall. Patio. Air conditioning. The location is away from downtown in an area called Point Loma that has good restaurants (walking)and the Cabrillo National Monument Area nearby (driving). There are even some bayside beaches. I swam at one and it seemed pretty clean. And the pool at the Pearl is small but great. Drinks and music poolside! We pretty much had it to ourselves twice. It also has its own restaurant but we didn't eat there. Near the airport, too, but we drove in.Downside: my wife disliked the hard bed intensely. The traffic noise from the street is loud. Parking is limited and ten bucks extra. No guarantee you'll get a spot. Far from downtown and no trolley nearby. Pillows were absurdly uncomfortable! Go figure. That sounds like an oxymoron: uncomfortable pillows. My wife complained that there was no full-length mirror. Oh, well. More upside than downside in my book. I thought it was so different from the average hotel and I really enjoyed that. Cool place.Appreciate your review and comments. Hope you will come stay with us again in the future. Tell a friend.
1272	4	Close to the Marina with public transportation accessible (and parking at the hotel available). Not particularly quiet, as it is on a busy street, but fun and interesting. Mid-century modern design, bar and restaurant open to the pool with nightly activities including movie night. Plenty of people come just for the fun, besides the small number of hotel guests.On behalf of the entire Pearl team, thank you for your kind review. We appreciate your support. Come visit us again soon.
1273	5	We loved everything about The Pearl Hotel. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and more accommodating. Our room was VERY clean. The bar was great as was the bartender! Loved the cocktails and enjoyed their happy hour. The food was amazing! Best fish taco I had on our trip. We used their bikes to ride along the harbor into down town San Diego. Everything about The Pearl is fun. It was just what we wanted - unique, clean, great service, fun and good location.On behalf of the entire Pearl team, THANK YOU for your great review. We truly appreciate it. Thrilled to hear our staff delivered an excellent guest experience. Hospitality is so important to us. Thanks again for your support. Visit us again soon. Tell a friend!

1289	4	Arrived about 9:30am on Thursday 4-30-15 for Jazz Fest weekend pulled into parking garage bellman and parking attendant handled everything we just waited for them to gather everything walked to the desk handed keys to room to our surprise room ready at 9:30am WONDERFUL!!!! Let's get this party started!!! Balcony room 2 double beds on Bourbon room was small but clean Balcony was the best!!! We were on 4th floor would have preferred 3rd or 2nd but was so happy it was ready when we got there it worked. For the smokers we were told ok to smoke if room door closed on balcony. We no longer smoke but do vape and we enjoyed sitting on the balcony vaping and watching all the going ons on Bourbon we seen it all!!! The man next door was smoking a cigar so all was good. The room was not cleaned while we were there but no big deal for us we were only there 3 nights and had plenty of towels and toilet paper. Really expensive during Jazz Fest but worth every penny we will be back!!!!Dear Antywarbuc,Thank you for your review.

1291	4	We stayed at the Four Points the second week in October. The location is right on Bourbon street and we were not bothered by any noise but being on the 4th floor might have helped. The staff was generally friendly, except for the after hours security guard at the main entrance. He was a bit rude. We had two adjoining rooms and one was quite cold and could not be adjusted any warmer. The room adjacent had the opposite problem being to warm and unable to adjust any cooler. The beds were comfy and the bathrooms were modern and clean. Breakfast service off the lobby was convenient and tasty but they did change the menu the last morning we were there shrinking the menu offerings. Overall a good stay and I would return again.Thank you Gerry for sharing your feedback with us. We are pleased to see you enjoyed your stay. We look forward to your next arrival.
1292	5	This hotel is in the middle of all the Bourbon Street , very convenient. Our room was huge and comfortable. It did however need more lighting in the room. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The in house restaurant served very good food. Breakfast were standard fare, basically buffet of scrambledeggs, meat, fruit, cereal and sometimes oatmeal. It was great just to walk out the hotel door and be right in the middle of all the activity!
1293	4	we really enjoyed our stay here. you can walk right out the front of the hotel and BOOM! you are smack dab in the middle of it all. Make sure you make a lap or two to find the best deals. The food at Oceana's and Margaritaville was great!! we will be backDear Matt M,We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your time with us as well as our convenient location in French Quarter. We look forward to seeing you again in the future! Take care.
1294	4	Stayed here in October for my cousins Bachelor party and for a bunch of mid 20 party goers we found this hotel to be perfect as it is right on bourbon street and in the French quarter of New Orleans. Locations was key for us and this was literally the perfect location as we only stayed on bourbon for the majority of our trip. The rooms weren't the most spacious but it was enough for four people. The pool area was outside and small. If you're looking for a quiet and relaxing getaway this might not be the place for you as the noise can spill into the hotel rooms that face bourbon street but rooms that face the side streets are somewhat quieter. Overall good stay and would return no questions asked. Thanks CostasDaGreek for taking the time to review your stay with us at the Four Points by Sheraton French Quarter. We are happy to see you enjoyed your time in New Orleans for the Bachelor Party and stay with us. We welcome you back anytime!
1295	5	We had a great experience here. The beds and pillows are really comfortable. It is loud outside, but we were tired at the end of the day so it didn't bother us much and we slept well. It was so fun being on the balcony. Mary the Concierge was wonderful. We enjoyed the live music and food at the bar. One downside: bathrooms are really small, and only one hook to hang towels.Dear expat5Warsaw,Thank you for being our guest at Four Points by Sheraton French Quarter. We love knowing you had an outstanding stay and that our team left a great impression. We cant wait to share your kind comments with Mary. Thanks so much for the kind review and look forward to having you as our guest again.Beth AblesGeneral Manager
1296	4	I was told by the Westin agent that this was far enough down on Bourbon St that it would be ok for my 8 and 9 yr old. Well, before we got in the door my kids saw what they called 3 naked girls...with paint on them. I asked the people at the desk if could switch to a different hotel and John Fisher, at the desk, helped us out and got us a switch over to The W....much better atmosphere for kids!
1297	3	Rates were high this weekend (129 +) so two nights were just under 300. To expensive for the overall quality. But I must say, the room was very clean comfortable.

1298	3	There is much construction going on in the hotel, but it didn't really affect our stay.

1300	4	Got to the hotel late at night, hard to see much outside to distinguish this property from others. Went bed quickly without looking around. So, limited impressions at first.The next morning, coffee in hand, I began to take more notice. The room had been renovated recently (new carpet, paint, trim, counter, furniture, TV service appliances, bath updated) Very comfortable. As I went outside, I noticed more about the grounds. New paint on the buildings, landscaping was very tidy. Everything was orderly and clean without being overdone (ala Disneyland).This property gives the impression of an ownership that takes pride in their establishment both in the physical presentation and in the service of the staff. They have worked hard to make thoughtful choices and quality improvements. Great value for the price.

1302	5	Great location, clean and large sized room. We forgot a ten year old bottle of wine in a drawer along with a blood pressure monitor upon checking out. When we remembered the next day that we had forgotten the items, we returned in hopes of recovering our items. Unfortunately the unit was re-rented and the guests were not in their room. So we figured we were out both our wine as well as our blood pressure unit.To our surprise some days later the front desk girl (a very kind young lady named Darby) contacted us and said she had both our forgotten pieces. She had searched her computer until she finally found our name and contacted us. Coming from Hawaii we were happy to feel the aloha spirit in California.....very refreshing. Thanks again for a great stay!Dear penn3222, Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at Chablis Inn. We are so happy to hear you had a great room experience, and were satisfied with our location. We're also happy that our staff was able to assist in returning your forgotten items, and we have shared your feedback with them. We know you have many choices when you visit Wine Country and we are honored that you chose Chablis Inn. We hope to see you next time you are in town! Dawn P.
1303	5	Had friends visiting from Ohio who wanted to spend a few days in Napa Valley. Found the Chablis Inn for less than 100 a night mid week with a AAA discount. Small property that's well maintained, very clean, has nice amenities and a great staff. They even kept the pool open for us a little later than usual. I will probably stay here any time I'm in Napa.
1304	5	Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We both slept well!! This was a first as we never sleep well when out. Pleasant, quiet, comfortable, and clean. Not a lot of frills but everything we needed. Has a pool and hot tub. Helpful staff. Surprised to find restaurants, stores, Starbucks more in close walking distance. Easy access to Route 29, and a bike path that leads into town. We were guests of our son, but he stays here often on business. He told us Chablis Inn offered the best quality for the money.
1305	1	We were supposed to stay here on September 30, 2012, but we had to change our plans. I canceled the reservation on August 20th and got a confirmation email about the confirmation. I was well within the 72 hour cancellation time period so that I would not be charged as a no show. I found out a couple of days ago that they charged my card anyway. I forwarded the confirmation email to them and asked them why they charged me, the general manager wrote back that he did the research, and because the reservation was never cancelled on their end, it wasn't considered cancelled, and I was being charged as a no show. He did, however offer me a credit towards a one night stay if I come to Napa in the next two years, which I won't. Needless to say, I'm disputing the charge with my bank.
1306	1	They lost my reservation,that should have been a clue, I should have left right then and there. The room was the size of a postage stamp.The mattress was way too soft. Internet was slower than molasses. Breakfast consisted of few donuts,mini muffins, 2 beat up apples and instant coffee. The TV was whistling the whole time,I think it was a model from the '90. Never again will they see me there. Book a room across the street at the Lobard Motor Inn, you'll be happy there.
1307	2	On check in we were greeted by a very helpful receptionist called Alex, unfortunately the rooms did not match up to the service ( the rooms were very old and decor was very dated, wallpaper from the late 80s. Room had a very strange smell and curtains did not reach the bottom of the ledge so the light from the car park flood lights were beaming straight through the window!!! The pillows were dreadful and the bed was so uncomfortable, we felt unsafe in this motel as well, walls paper thin and doors slammin constantly , very noisy outside too- i know this is not the hotels fault but just adds to the awful stay we had. we paid around 85 per night for this hotel which may seem reasonable for location, however we stayed at the coventry motor inn just up the road and it was by far do much better than the Francisco bay inn.Overall good location and staff but dirty, noisy, dated , smelly motel rooms!!!! Better motels in the area for same price!!! Not recommended
1308	3	The room decor is dated and somewhat shabby, but this can be overlooked given the room cost and location. The Inn is within walking distance to shops and restaurants on Union Street and Fort Mason. You can get to Union Square, the Mission, Hayes Valley or North Beach in 15 minutes via Muni bus routes just a couple of blocks from the hotel. We used routes 47, 49, and 30. It was only a 15 minute walk from the northern end of the Powell-Mason cable car line. This is a good base for exploring Pacific Heights, the Marina, and Russian Hill. The room linens are clean, parking is free, and there are newish refrigerators and microwaves in the room. If you don't plan on spending much time in your room and prefer to spend money on dining and entertainment, this is a good option. If you're in town on a Friday, walk up to Fort Mason for great food at the Off the Grid food truck street fair.
1309	4	we had never been to san francisco before and for our first trip, we were pleasantly surprised when we stayed here in sept. our room was pretty small but very clean, the staff was extremely helpful and the location was excellent. we definately want to go back and we would for sure stay at this great, affordable hotel!
1310	4	After reading some of the negative views below, I had to check to see if it was the same hotel we stayed in.All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was spotlessly clean and both it and the bathroom was a really good size. All the furnishings were pristine. Perhaps we were fortunate to have a room at the back so noise was not a problem. Tea and coffee facilities were supplied together with a coffee maker, microwave, fridge and TV. Free WIFI was also available.A continental breakfast was laid out in Reception but trays were provided for you to take it to your room if preferred.The location of the hotel was perfect for walking or taking public transport to all the high spots in San Francisco. With free parking there are no worries about driving into the very busy streets of San Francisco. What more could you want.
1311	4	We only stayed one night and got a good rate for the area. Walking distance to the Crookedest Street and right on Lombard, its location is close to Fisherman's Wharf, Ghirardelli, etc walking distance if you like to walk, if not you can catch a bus and it'll take you there in less than 10 minutes. The staff was very nice and helpful specially Roberto. He answered all of our questions and gave us excellent customer service. Room was nothing special, but it did have a microwave, fridge, iron and small hair dryer and was very clean. This is just the place you need if you are interested in spending most of your time out in the city and are looking for a place to rest. There is city noise but come on, what else can you expect I didn't mind it at all. Def not a deal breaker. This is not a resort, just a place to sleep...so ignore the picky people trying to be - well, picky.
1312	3	After reading a number of reviews about this place we decided to give it a try. The hotel itself is a motel. The staff that we experienced were all good and helpful. The Inn does sit at a busy intersection but with the A/C unit on in the room we heard very little through the night. We did face Lomard Street. The room was big with a fridge, microwave and coffee maker. These would come in handy as I would not consider the continental breakfast provided to be substantial by any means. However, it was something in the morning before leaving and finding some real food. The bathroom was big and clean though it could have used a couple of more towels. There was no problem having hot water for our showers in the morning. The linens were clean. The bed could have been more comfortable for our liking but we are all different and expect different things from our beds.Not being familiar with the lay of the land we took the info provided of others indicating it was only a 15 minute walk to the pier 39 and also used this in our decision to stay here. The location for being central is great. YOu are no more than 20 minutes to Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39. If you walk the other way you are about the same to Crissy Field and the Presidio. The World's Crookedest Street is about 4 uphill blocks away. Getting to here from the airport was uneventful and quite easy. The neighbourhood it is in is safe by our standards and we did not feel uncomfortable walking back from the pier alter in the evening. There are some wonderful restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood as well no more than a 10 minute walk in the direction of the Presidio on Chestnut.The free parking and internet were also added benefits considering the cost of parking in some areas and other hotels in San Francisco.With all this said it is not the greatest nor is it the worst. For the money we paid in San Francisco it did provide value for our dollar. As others have stated if you want upscale you will pay for it but this is not that place.
1313	2	We were looking for a last minute day trip for the president's day weekend and because it was last minute our top three choices were booked, so we decided on this inn. We booked a suite and the rooms were clean, had fresh towels and coffee throughout the stay the microwave and small fridge were also nice.On our 3rd night someone walked right into our room at about 2 in the morning!! OMG scared the living heck out of us informed the management in the a.m. he didn't seem too concerned, actually he seemed annoyed.Yes it is within walking distance of all the best places, but the breakfast is laughable, and I swear there are working girls/men or druggies who frequent this hotel, there is just too much foot traffic on the balcony at odd times of the night,the management is just plain rude, once you have paid your money you are out of luck and they don't care. Do yourself a favor stay elsewhere and enjoy San Francisco it is a great city!!
1314	3	Be careful when you book this hotel. They dont include the full sales tax until after u book and pay for it. Got charged an extra 27 on my credit card and when i called they said they cant do anything. Its like paying 113 for a room, for that kind of money i would of rented somewhere else much nicer.
1315	1	Please see my review of 11-9-2014 in the Terrible Category. I decided to give the Hotel another try, really nothing has changed. The room assigned was near the highway, so noise is still present. Wall are paper thin, so you can hear outside noise as well as your neighbors, doors slam with a loud noise. HVAC system is weak, and... More
1316	5	The staff is outstanding. The amenities are excellent. It is very modern and clean with great attention to being green. The indoor heated pool and free-to-use bicycles are an added bonus. I love this hotel.
1317	5	This was a return visit to the Mt Washington Conference Center. Our room was very comfortable, with exceptionally good beds. The grounds are extensive with a variety of lovely trees and plants. Rooms come with a extensive continental breakfast, and use of well-equipped fitness center in McAuley Hall, accessible by indoor corridor. Room was clean, staff were helpful, and staff... More
1318	3	I booked this hotel way in advance for the Billy Joel concert because I wanted to be able to walk back to hotel instead of getting on train. At first I did not look at my reservation, my fault, and went to the Hotel Lincoln instead.I was very excited when I got here. great customer service, friendly and helpful.The desk clerk said I was not in the system so i checked my paper and he said I was at wrong hotel. The baggage guy was so nice and loaded my stuff back into my car and waited for my husband to go get car. We arrived at The Inn at Lincoln Park and it did offer parking for 30 per night and we were so tired of riding in the car we said sure. They have window air conditioners and no electric door and no elevator. I was less than thrilled but we were not going to let it ruin our night. Get to the room and it is extremely small and you have to keep you curtains open if you want air to get into the room. Everything was pretty old and out lamp shade had a big stain on it. The pillows were like postage stamps and it was def no frills. We were woken at 6 am by a loud drilling from below. Not sure what it was but I guess that is the city. The price, even being in the city was ridiculous and I should have used a Groupon for a nicer hotel and took the train to concert. This place was not that close, even to walk. I guess if you like no frills and high prices you should stay here.
1319	2	On entry, the lobby was quite tired: old carpet, paint chipping, etc. Hallways and room had a old, dusty odor, but the window did open, so we could get fresh air. Everything in the bedroom was old (not quite historic), with rusty fixtures in the bathtub. We were on the fourth floor, so it took a long time on our first morning to get steady hot water, and then later that afternoon - no hot water at all. There is no excuse for a lack of hot water at a hotel in the Second City.The price should have given me a clue. I read the reviews here before booking and lent more credence to those that saw it as 'quaint', but in reality it's just bad. I need to be renovated top to bottom.Staff were nice enough, and maybe in the 'home country' this hotel might have been acceptable, but not here, not in Chicago, not in any major US city.Would have been much better to spend the extra 200 and stay at the Willows one block away.We apologize about the issues you had while staying at our hotel. We are not sure why you had issues with the hot water. We had not received any complaints so it may have been isolated to your room only. We are in the process of finalizing our new hotel that will be built on the current site to give our guests an updated space with many more amenities. We are not sure what the meaning of home country is but we are an american owned and operated hotel. We are an economy hotel that can offer clean, quiet rooms at a discounted rate for the traveler coming to the Chicago area. Thank you again for your comments. Paul Schoonover - General Manager
1320	5	So i had no idea what to expect with the Moxy going into it, but after one minute of being there, I knew that the place was amazing. First off, I have never been so entertained at a hotel. The music was fun to dance to, the drinks were phenominal, just ask Kathleen to make you one, and the games were so fun! (They had a two player pacman machine!!) The room itself was pretty sweet, and we had a wonderful view of the skyscrapers around the city. The front desk was amazing giving us restaurant recommendations, i forgot his name, but was either like David or Matt... point is the guy working at the Front Desk was awesome. They are like your best friends and treat you like a guest, not a peasant. Zombie Taco had wonderful food, and the lady behind the counter was wonderful. The single complaint, which isn't even that big of a deal for me, was that the bed was slightly firmer for my friend, but that wasn't even that bad for him. The housekeeping was great, front desk was great, Moxy Chicago was great. I will always keep them in mind when coming to stay in Chicago again, because they made my trip absolutely amazing.Hey Daniel P!YOUR GREAT! Thanks for hanging out with our crew at the Moxy Chicago! We love to hear that enjoyed our unique amenities and delicious tacos. We can't wait to have you back already! Peace. Love. Moxy.
1321	4	We first stayed at Smitty's three or four years ago, and we have since stayed there at least once a year. It is a place that draws one back. Smitty's is not modern, but it is rustic and lovely. The family who operate it know how to make you feel comfortable and welcome. In the evening guests gather in the... More
1322	1	The room I stayed in had mold all over the shower head. The room was muggy feeling. This is the second Ramada I've stayed at that was a negative experience. The first time I tried to get in contact with the manager on numerous occasions and never heard back from management so I didn't even bother this time. I left... More
1323	5	I had stayed at the hotel in October with my bf. The room was on the smaller side but very comfortable, clean and modern. The location was good, right by the airport. For us, the noise of the airplanes did not bother us. Once and awhile you noticed it but nothing crazy that we couldnt sleep. But what do you expect youre by an airport. They have a really nice shower with a sliding door for privacy. No lock on the door but it slides shut for privacy. Also had a fridge which was a plus as well as a coffee maker :) Down in the lobby they had a station called refresh, and that was really cool. You could get food, snacks and ice cream. That made it easy because you didnt have to leave the hotel to get snacks if you were hungry. They had an outside sitting area which was really chic and modern. It was nice to watch the planes fly in. Another awesome feature was they had a 24 hr. gym and it was a nice one. Not sure about the pool hrs. but they had a nice sized pool there as well. Only problem we had encountered was with the gate. We could never get it to work when we left and entered, Always had to bug the poor girl inside to open it for us. Other than that it was a beautiful modern hotel with great amenities, clean rooms and a friendly sharply dressed staff. I would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again. I loved how modern this hotel was and how it had everything we needed that I actually want to go to some of their other hotels in random states just to try them out too.
1324	3	I was married on Anna Maria so it has a special place in my heart. I like to go over for quick weekend stays but this can be hard with more condos on the island than hotels. I stayed here over a year ago and the location is great. The rooms needed some improvements and there were some bug issues.... More
1325	5	Great Facility - loved it - hope to repeat. It would be even better if staff are able to help more with general questions- but I suppose you have the internet. So you can look up. Good clean facility - if you are traveling with family and limit eating outDear suvhasis, thank you so much for choosing us, we are glad you enjoyed your stay. We are in the process of hiring a concierge manager in order to have a person dedicated to help with general questions for the client.
1326	1	Very upset with my stay at this hotel. Room is nice but staff is extremely rude and incompetent. Female manager made us vacate the hotel room at 1AM in the morning because of an error that her staff made. Showed no empathy or concern for her guests, was rude and threatened us. She also refused to give me her name. I don't recommend the hotel just because of the staff. Didn't even receive my deposit back. Overall, horrible experience.
1327	3	The hotel and room was very clean and looked exactly like the photos. However the furniture was very stiff and uncomfortable. The hotel is at least 15 minutes away from beach not including traffic (30 minutes with traffic). Parking is ridiculous so the additional 20 a day for parking is worth it versus the risk of being towed overnight for 200. Overall the condo was awesome for the extremely low price and I will recommend to anyone who is vacationing on a budget. Dear Christina E, We are sorry for any inconveniences, we do charge parking as around brickell there is not enough parking, the hotels near by charge up to 30 per night. we are glad you enjoyed your stay and we hope to see you again.
1328	5	So happy I found this place! My family and I needed something close to American Airlines Arena for a concert and this place was perfect. Clean, new, friendly staff! Was very happy with our stay and we will definitely be back! 5 stars!Dear Sage W, Thank you so much for choosing us, it was a pleasure to host you. We are glad you enjoyed your stay as much as we enjoyed having you here.
1329	5	We really enjoyed our stay and will most likely be back! Thank you I really want to know what your pillows are made from and would like to buy four of them as they were so comfortable ever! Can you tell me how
1330	4	Nice Best Western with friendly, helpful staff. Corner room was clean and temperature was easily controlled. Breakfasts were good, but sometimes a little hectic with limited seating. When that happened, we were just forced to sit out by the pool and enjoy the beautiful Southern California weather!!Thank you for your wonderful comments about your stay with Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel. I'm glad you had a great experience during your visit to San Diego. We hope to see you again soon.
1331	5	Very well located, near San Diego et La Jolla. There are great restaurants nearby!!! The pool is a good size and very clean! The breakfast is correct and the choice of food and beverages is ok. Good service and friendly staff!!!
1332	2	We had an amazing road trip, after getting married in Las Vegas, ending in San Francisco. This hotel however was the biggest disappointment of our trip. We had booked the Hilton, but then found this at half the cost decided to book it so we could spend our money on other things. We wished we'd stuck with the Hilton. I'm not normally one for writing a bad review (in fact it's my 1st I feel like I'm being mean!) it wasn't really that bad, it just wasn't the best one on our trip. We'd booked a cheaper one in Morro Bay, (we wanted to experience a Motel) which knocked the socks of this hotel for both room service!Before we arrived we had emailed the hotel to let them know we had just got married, to ask if they had any upgrades. They kindly offered us 2 options: a free upgrade to a garden view or a paid one into a front facing harbour view. We said yes to the paid one, as it was our honeymoon after all. When we arrived at the hotel, the guy on reception had no details about it at all. When we asked about it he said we would have to speak to the manager in the morning and see if there were any free the next day. We were disappointed to say the least, especially as we had the email with the confirmation. We didn't bother speaking to the manager the next day, we were only there for 2 nights didn't want to spend the time moaning:) So we just took the room they had. It was ok. We found out it was the garden view (overlooking 3 palm trees:)). It was clean did the job. Breakfast was not great. Greasy food most of it looked unhygienic. So I didn't bother. My husband ate the bagels. Before we went out for the day I asked reception about a group of seals we had heard about by the harbour where we were likely to find them. He basically laughed at me and said 'you'll just hear them, they are everywhere'. Thought it was a bit rude. As it turns out we saw hundreds all the way up highway 1, quite an experience for us coming from the UK. If you just want a cheaper option for a pit stop, it will do the job. It was clean after all. If you want somewhere nicer, book the Hilton.
1333	5	Landed late in San Diego and chose the hotel and what a nice place to stay. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Very quiet and continental breakfast had a good variety. Underground parking was easy and safe. Highly recommended if you need a place close to the airport.Thank you for staying with Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel. We are glad you enjoyed your room and our location. Hope to see you again soon on your next trip to San Diego pleas contact the hotel directly for any future reservations at 619-224-3254
1334	5	I really had a great time at this hotel as it is within walking distance to Liberty Stations, Point Loma Seafoods, Ralph's Grocery Store, and Shelter Island. This hotel is very clean, private, and spacious.
1335	4	We had a four night stay here , it was pleasant the harbour views are fantastic,staff friendly,good breakfast ,the only downside is constant humming of the vending machines when you sleep as they are loud,good location
1336	3	We noticed online, this hotel had both a waterview and balcony roons, which is what we were looking to book. We arrived at the hotell and was disappointed to find our view from our 2nd floor room. Was nothinf more than the very tops of sailing mast, behind buildings, way off in the distance. And since the hotel is fronted by a busy 4 lane highway. The road noise on our small balcony, was so loud, you had to shout over the loud road noise, making it useless. Apon request, we move to 4th floor rm. The room's AC unit was so load, it should never been offer and was probably the reason it hadn't already been booked and leftout of service. Since there really isn't much of a view of the harbour, we gave up on a veiw rm and moved to a 3rd floor quite parking lot side room. But the rugs here had been shampoo and were soaken wet. So we moved again, to a different 3rd floor quite paking lot view room. I think we'd paid extra for the harbour view room to bega with, it's not worth it and we never were offer a refund for the different type room we stayed in. We visit San Diego ever year and won't stay here again.
1337	4	There can be a lot of traffic noise as it is close to the street, but it is bearable and there are rooms away from the traffic. The breakfast was very enjoyable overall a nice place to stay and for a great value.Thank you for your comments about your stay with Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel. I'm glad you had a great experience during your visit to San Diego. We hope to see you again soon.
1338	4	Excellent value. Located walking distance from harbor, food, coffee and bars. Nice little pool. Clean and friendly. The staff was very helpful. Breakfast was simple but good. Close to the airport. Found a gem, Adaberto's Mexican food just a few blocks away.
1339	5	I got the room, view and bed I requested for my family of three. We had a beautiful view of the harbor but I was a little bit bummed I couldn't see downtown due to a stairwell blocking that view. We were on the fifth floor though and had a view of the pool which was helpful when our 15 year old son went swimming and I was able to call down to him when I had a question for him. Our son came with us at the last minute so we had to add on a rollaway bed and that caused no problem at all. We left the hotel, shortly after checking in and when we returned, the bed was there. The room and rest of the hotel was clean and inviting. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was hot when we first arrived but the air conditioner worked perfect and cooled it down in little time. Our son used the pool and swam alone (for the first time in his life) for the entire time he was there. The pool temp and condition was perfect and he said it was nice and he really liked it. Even though the hotel was sold out, we never felt like it was crowded and never heard our neighbors. We also found parking in the covered lot on both nights we arrived back late. The breakfast was just ok. It is a continental breakfast though so in that vein, it was normal. However, it was very clean in the room and pleasantly decorated and arranged. They had a separate dining area for overflow or if you didn't want to be in the room with the food prep and television. The staff were friendly and helpful. Overall, we had a wonderful stay here and I'd definitely return to the same location to stay overnight again. The highlight was walking out onto our balcony, on the last morning we were there (on a Sunday), to the view of the harbor with The Star Spangled Banner playing on speakers nearby, just loud enough for me to get misty-eyed. Beautiful moment.
1340	5	Just stayed for 3 nights, the hotel is in a great location across the road from the harbor. There are plenty of places to eat near by and lovely walks around the harbor. The hotel is great and the breakfast is good, the rooms are large with a balcony and there is a swimming pool and free parking. The staff are friendly especially Celine who worked at bight on reception she was so friendly and genuinely interested in talking to you and gave us great information for what to do on our forward trip she was such a nice person. Highly recommend this hotel.
1341	5	Thanks guys and gals for all the great service. Good secure parking was offered and the rooms quiet and with fab sea views for sunset viewing. The assistant was very helpful when getting us set for our bike ride. Thankyou. Our rooms were made up...MoreThank you so much for staying with us at the Pacific Terrace Hotel! We enjoyed reading your review, sounds like your family had such a great time. Most of all we are very pleased to see you will highly recommend our hotel, we appreciate it...More
1342	5	My wife and I had the pleasure of staying with the Mandarian for our first wedding anniversary. From the beginning, the experience was impeccable. Food, view, service and fitness...not to mention the fortunate weather - this could not have gone better. Once in a while, you find a business, resturant or in this case hotel that treats its clients as if they were related. The Mandarian is just that. Comfort, class with consistent effort throughout their goal is YOURS.Thank you to all who made this moment last a lifetime.
1343	5	A tranquil and first class hotel. A bit out of the craziness of Miami on a quiet island right off of Brickell makes it extra special. The staff is fabulous and the rooms are lovely. Always our first choice!
1344	5	Everything about this hotel is top notch. The setting, the architecture, the dcor and the amenities. The attention to detail is obvious in the service, the maid service, the menu etc. The food is really good. Shockingly good for a hotel and the service matched the food.The workout room seemed to be an afterthought, but otherwise I would highly recommend
1345	5	My partner and I visited Miami for the first time and spent some time at this hotel during our stay. The views are amazing from this Hotel. The facility is huge, lots of walking space, jogging running along the water line. The hotel is splendid and so was the service.
1346	5	Has everything you would expect from a good business hotel. Bathroom can also open up to the bedroom so you can watch TV from the tub. A bit tricky to find the turning to the hotel since it is not signposted off 8th. Check-in staff a bit teutonic. Concierge was more friendly, helpful. Nice gym, pool. Parking is USD24/night.
1347	5	This hotel is by far the best in Miami! Best service overall. From the valet staff to the housekeeping staff, to the front desk staff, and the servers at the reasturant. We were treated with such genuine care. I would highly recommend this hotel to family's as we travels with our 9 month old and we're greeted with a teddy bear for him!
1348	5	The room was incredible and spacious. Very comfortable and clean. The bathroom was spacious with a tub and separate shower. The mini bar items were diverse and extensive. Great room service options too. The hotel itself is on a very nice island with jogging trails and a private beach. It is a short drive to downtown Miami but a long cab ride to South Beach. If you are looking for a great little getaway a short drive from the airport that is like a little oasis, while not needing the glitz of South Beachthis is the place! There is a great restaurant called Azul in the hotel too.The only criticism was the TV. It was far too complicated to operate and I consider myself fairly technical. But while staying at a hotel, I dont want to spend time learning the nuances of the TV system. While I am sure it was expensive and the screen was very large, the time it took to learn the operation of the TV was too long.
1349	4	We stayed here after returning from Key West. The hotel is really nicely located on a little island, looking back at downtown across the water. We got a nice upgrade to a suite, and loved the night skyline. Had dinner at La Mar and enjoyed the Peruvian food there. The pool area and little beach is popular and busy. The staf is really friendly, and higly professional.My only disappointment was with how loud the airco blower in the room was.
1350	5	I arrived at the hotel at 1:30 AM and was warmly greeted by the doorman. My next interaction was also positive at the front desk. Then I opened the door to my room. Wow, it was wonderful and spacious. At breakfast I saw Will Smith!
1351	1	I am writing the review at the hotel. Lets just put aside the inconvenience of the location aside at the moment. I chose to stay here inside of the south beach because I want a quiet hotel but guess what, there are plane flying over my head every ten minutes! And guess what, when I called the front desk they told me they have never heard any plane noise. I went down to talk to the manager on duty and he claimed he has never had any complaints and he has been working here for two years. They are treating me as if I made this up. I invited the manager on duty to go to my room to prove that there are planes noise every ten minutes. He heard it himself very inevitably and instead of trying to solve the problem, simply told me that there is nothing he can do about the planes. I told him that I am aware of it but is the other side of the hotel going to be better I asked. Of course he can't answer the questions since he claimed no guests have complained about the noise before...well they must all be deaf. I requested to check the rooms on the other side of the hotel. We went together and it's slightly better, the catch is its facing a main road and there is traffic. I truly dislike how they handle my complaints. Now lets get to some other technical issue. The vents of the air conditioning blows directly to the bed onto my head so I can't turn any air conditioning on. By the way they don't give you adapters, they are part of the minibar item so you need to purchase them. Not to mention that one needs to purchase wifi connection. That is the least of the problems. By the way I asked the manager on duty in light of the noise of planes on the one side and the traffic on the other side of the hotel, which is the lesser of two evils for an insomniac like me. He said it would be the side facing traffic. Oh so he finally heard the plane noise So I didn't make it up after all! Shame on this mandarin oriental. The chain should disown this property to preserve its standard. Do not stay here!Dear Ms. Yao,I am very sorry to read of the noise disturbance you encountered which has also been brought to my attention by our Front Office Manager and our Rooms Division Director, who has tried contacting you.Please understand that Mandarin Oriental, Miami was built with the highest of standards and to withstand category five hurricane force winds.We are an urban city resort, tucked away on a semi private island, away from the traffic noise of downtown and the South Beach festive scene.

Please contact me at your earliest convenience to see what we can do to help make your stay a restful one.Kind regards,Greg NunezHotel Manager
1352	5	Stayed at the MO about five years ago and we were impressed. We still find it a fantastic hotel, with an extremely comfortable bed. I was most impressed with the staff. I lost my watch at the pool area and didn't realize it until late evening. They searched through towels and then the whole pool area by flashlight and found it and returned it. Great Peruvian restaurant in the hotel and lots of other restaurants within easy walking distance.
1353	5	I thoroughly enjoyed my one night visit after a crap week of meetings at the Hilton downtown. Stay away from that property. The service and accommodation excellence was probably the best I've experienced. I've stayed at various ritz, intercontinental, four seasons and this mandarin was outstanding. Spa was very relaxing even without a treatment. Room service food quality was impressive. Hot food hot, cold food cold and awesome flavors. Will definitely visit again.
1354	1	The Good:-Clean rooms.-Room service twice daily.-Room size is adequate.-Valet parking gets your car fast and parks it fast as well.-Hotel looks clean and nice in general.The Bad:-There is no private beach as advertized, it is a small, man-made beach, with no access to water.-The pool is very small compared to the size of the hotel.-Valet parking is mandatory and costs 34 per day, other (and better) hotels charge only 30 per day.-The fan in the bathroom in our room did not work and was not fixed despite complainig.-The toilette flush in our bathroom takes FOREVER to refill and was not fixed despite complaining (I have used the so-called ECO flushed in many older and modern hotels, so I know how it is supposed to work, ours was not functionning normally, nor as intended.-The batrhoom sink did not drain, they fixed it after we complained.-The hotel rooms show unusual signs of aging, despite the hotel being only around 10yrs. old.-The staff is arrogant and border-line rude (except for the valet parking guys, who are great).-The food at the hotel is marginal, the fruits in our 60 breakfast for 2 were NOT fresh, and we could not eat them. - As staff was so arrogant and our previous complaints were ignored (regarding the bathroom issues) we did not even bother complaining about stale fruits posing as fresh ones...we were happy it was our last day.-In general I recommend Trump and Sofitel hotels over Mandarin Oriental.Dear Guest,Thank you for your recent review of Mandarin Oriental, Miami on Trip Advisor. We sincerely apologize that your visit did not meet your expectations. Our private beach is not promoted as one for swimming but for relaxing and enjoying the stunning views. The tranquility and surroundings of our pool and beach provide a quiet escape for our guests.I am sorry to learn of the plumbing related issues. I will address this with our Engineering team to ensure there are no further problems.Additionally, I regret to hear the lapse in service you indicated by our staff. We pride ourselves in ensuring all our colleagues deliver quality service and genuine hospitality to our guests and make sure their visit is seamless and enjoyable. Please understand we only purchase quality, fresh produce and turn away anything that is not up to our standards. As far as the pricing, we are competitively priced with other luxury hotels in the area.With regards to the valet parking, due to the limited space available for parking facilities in the area, we do need to charge a fee for overnight stays. Most Miami hotels experience the same situation and charge rates equivalent or higher.I do apologize again that your stay was not an enjoyable experience.SincerelyJorge GonzalezGeneral Manager
1355	4	We stayed at the MO for one week in February whilst the Boat Show, President's Weekend and the Food and Drink Fair were on consequently the hotel was very busy. There is no doubt that the MO is very luxurious, however be careful that you do not end up with a room overlooking the bridge road, as we did initially before they changed it the day after checking in. The hotel is in 3 sections of a curve and one third of the back section looks over this bridge, so ask for either the centre section or the section overlooking the pool. The reception staff vary in their desire to accommodate any disappointments, so if at first you don't succeed, try again with someone else! It is a particular concern that there is a major flight path right over the hotel, which seems quite bad at certain times of the day: the very expensive breakfast on the terrace was somehow marred by this experience, as were our sessions by the pool. I can't believe no one else has commented on this. Regarding the spa, I paid for a rather useless pilates session: like a previous reviewer, the teacher was a sweet girl and I did not like to complain about her, but I had thought the MO spa would ensure that all their staff were excellent in their field. My final negative comment is that the beach was out of bounds more times than not during our stay due to private parties and the time taken to set up these parties: although it did not bother us, I'm sure some people would mind if this was one of the features which attracted them to the hotel.Despite these comments, our family did enjoy our stay!
1356	5	I came to Miami for a couple of days during March to have a break from Manhattan Island. Luxury bed made me sleep half of the day plus entire night up until morning. Breakfast was mouth-watering, and an awesome view made my morning truly inspiring. Reception desk gave a special attention to my interests and arranged all the trips and local reservations for me. Solicitous personnel at the pool knew their job very well. At night a restaurant downstairs gets packed, and no surprises here! Food is really delicious! The room was clean, and service was very considerate, as always. Definitely, the best place to stay.
1357	5	I recently attended a business conference at the hotel. It is a first class property - a great facility with a great staff. The rooms are comfortable and all have great views. My only criticism would be the lack of coffee makers in the rooms. The restaurants in the hotel are great, as is the gym. While the pool is nice, the beach is not an ocean beach, so be sure to manage your expectations. The service is excellent throughout the hotel. Also, be sure to be aware of the location - it is near downtown, but everything else (South Beach, etc.) is a ride.
1358	5	Our hotel stay at the Mandarin Oriental Miami, has to be one of the best we have had while travelling the USA. The attention to details in the appointment of the hotel ambience and rooms was perfect, as well as extremely attentive staff, who were all so accommodating to our needs... as well as anticipating what we would've needed! A special shout out to Angela, who greeted us every morning and was extremely friendly in assisting my sister and my own needs.I also recommend going to ESPA the hotel, as well as using the terrific facilities.I will definitely be coming back to Miami, and especially to the Mandarin Oriental!
1359	5	We have traveled all over the US and Europe on business and pleasure and the Mandarin Oriental staff is by far the most focused on customer service of anywhere we have ever stayed. No desire or need was ignored. The room was spacious and well equipped. The grounds are lovely with an infinity pool and beach area. The sushi was fresh and delicious. The hotel sits on Brickell Key overlooking Biscayne Bay. We stayed in a room with a terrace and enjoyed sitting on the terrace looking at the lights at night. Wonderful!
1360	5	We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for four nights in April. We booked a deluxe bayview room and it was so beautiful, clean, and comfortable. Every employee we encountered including all doormen, front desk, concierge, housekeeping, pool, beach, and restaurant staff were outstanding. Really stellar service. We had breakfast at La Mar each morning and the food was wonderful. The hotel is in a great location as you could walk across the bridge and find many great restaurants and bars. We will definately be back....we loved it. Special thanks to Cindy at the front desk, Pamela at MO Lounge, Mihel at the pool, and Adriana in housekeeping who cleaned our room to perfection each day!
1361	5	By far my favorite property ever! The location is great, the level of service is beyond spectacular. Five star experience and we cannot wait to return. The skyline view is my favorite. The breakfast buffet is outstanding and the spa is also top notch.
1362	4	My wife and I stayed for 2 days at the hotel. The hotel is very nice and the staff were very kindly and helpfull. Looking by the photos i believed that they had access to the beach, but it is a bay view. We seated at the chairs on the bay view area and ordered food...it was everything all right then suddenly a iguanas gang came attacked all the food. I think it was about 3 or 4 of them, and nothing that i could do stop them kkkkk. It was so bizarre that we decided to get out and go to the city.Dear Guest, Thank you for your review of Mandarin Oriental, Miami on Trip Advisor. Your constructive comments are extremely important to us. I sincerely apologize for the unfortunate and rare encounter you had with iguanas on our private beach. I am delighted to discuss your experience so please feel free to reach out to the Executive Office.I look forward to personally hearing from you.Sincerely,Jorge GonzalezGeneral Manager
1363	5	The moment we entered the Mandarin Oriental in Miami we were greeted as if we were special. The hotel staff is wonderful! They make certain that guests have everything they need. The location of MO is absolutely spectacular--the best of Miami's Brickell scene. Easy walking distance to trendy shops and restaurants, however, once you enter the Manderin Oriental you'll forget about visiting those places and just want to relax in the zen atmosphere. Did I say we had a great time Amazing weekend.
1364	5	My girlfriend and I stayed here for a weekend to celebrate her birthday and we did not leave the hotel grounds. We stayed in a Deluxe Skyline View Room, which offers beautiful views on a large private balcony. The manager surprised my friend with a tray of wine and sweets for her birthday. We throughly enjoyed the pool and bar area. We lunched at La Mar and dined at Azul. Overall, it was the perfect weekend in a perfect hotel.
1365	5	Although I don't often stay in a luxury hotel, the Mandarin Oriental, Miami provided exceptional accomodations and service. Their attention to detail and the courtesy of the staff was unsurpassed. The property was beautiful and the room was spacious
1366	5	My husband surprised me for our anniversary. The service was top notch from the moment we were recieved by the valet. A welcome beverage was served to cool off from the summer heat. The room was super comfortable and incredibly clean but the balcony was very small(just large enough to stand on but no room for furniture of any kind). Other than that, i have not one complaint about this hotel. Some if miami's highest rated restaurants are in the hotel as well as the amazing spa. Tried to top my hubby by booking at the biltmore for his birthday but they dropped the ball on several aspects. The mandarin is definitely the way to go.
1367	5	While South Beach is unquestionably a better place to be located for access to night life and beaches, the Mandarin Oriental is a great option for business travelers or conference attendees who won't have time in their schedule to leave the hotel. It's unquestionably the best hotel in the downtown area. While swimming isn't permitted off the man-made island, it does have a great swimming pool and beach area. Only downside is that it is surprisingly hard to get taxis to pick up from the hotel in the evenings.
1368	5	The staff from the front desk, the breakfast room to the housekeeping all displayed Best Western's Vision, to lead the industry in superior customer care. It was a great experience for me and my family. The property was so beautiful and the views were incredible, from the moment we waked in we felt at home. We can not wait to... More
1369	4	We have stayed here two other times before this. The staff on evening and morning shift were very pleasant and helpful. The rooms were clean and quiet. In the am we had car trouble and the staff was helpful to direct us to the nearest car dealer.
1370	5	Very clean, convenient to interstate, quiet. Three restaurants nearby. Nice pool and hot tub. Comfortable beds, lots of outlets, flat panel TV. Super hot breakfast, although on Y delux continental was advertised. Comfortable sitting/eating area.
1371	3	The location was perfect for me as it was central to all my needs. The hotel itself, right along with all the other hotels in the area, is older. You will have to wait for the elevator that services 3 floors. You will feel like you are walking down the hallway in the Shining and at any moment two little... More
1372	5	I love this place. As a platinum member they were able to upgrade me to a very nice room. Unfortunately the TV didn't work I call downstairs and Sean who is the front desk manager that evening gave me another room with an upgrade with the TV works the room was excellent and in addition he gave me a breakfast... More
1373	2	This is the worst Fairfield I have stayed at. Black flecks in our bath water! Don't drink the water. First shower in the morning yields black flecks. Reported this to many of the young girls who run the front desk and they don't seem surprised or interested. Description-Dirty exterior-cigarettes and trash, non-automatic door, dirty elevator, trash on top of the... More
1374	5	Nice hotel if slightly expensive. Difficult to enter reception with heavy cases up steps, but there is actually a ramp available at the side. Nice clean and quiet room with a very comfortable bed. Good wifi and a very nice breakfast. All staff were very...MoreThank you for your recent stay with us and for your feedback, which is very important to us. We are pleased to see that your stay went well and that you found our breakfast very nice and our staff very helpful. We do hope to...More
1375	3	First, some things that us question our choice: We arrived for a long stay around 10pm on a Friday and the lobby main door was locked... we had to use a bullet proof night window to check in (like a bank would have in a not so nice part of town). After feigning hearing issues with her behind glass, I asked to be let in the lobby and was let in and saw security camera monitors were pointed at every possible corner of the grounds. We got a room on the 3rd floor and the automatic door facing the hall to the rooms was broken. We had to walk all the way around the outside. We get to the elevator and its down for maintenance. I went back into the lobby and asked for a first floor room or second floor at least and she gave us one. When we got in the room though we were pleasantly surprised. The room looked updated for the most part with a nice granite counter outside the bathroom, counter height refrigerator and microwave. Horrible outdated tv though and ours had a loud screeching sound until it got warmed up. Bathroom was unbearably small. You had to step in and go behind the toilet to close the door. Outlets were lacking too. My husband and I both use our cell phones as alarms and want to plug in our phones next to the bed but there were not outlets anywhere near it. I had to unplug a lamp on the other side of the room. Beds and pillows were comfortable. Breakfast was blah but I wasn't expecting much from continental. Lo and behold, something else was broken! There are two Belgian waffle makers and one was out of order so we waited a very long time for our turn. Cereal, pastries, toast, coffee, etc. Every piece of fruit I got was a little past prime. Nothing to rave about.Overall, for the money, great deal and adequate for short hotel stay.
1376	3	Nice average hotel that's about 20 minutes from downtown.Some friends and I stayed here during Comic Con and it was easy access onto the highways. The staff was friendly and helpful. When we called down for extra towels they were up within 10 minutes. If you don't mind a little drive to downtown San Diego, this is for you. The room could use a makeover but was fairly clean. There is a swimming pool and whirlpool on the premises. Decent selections for their complimentary breakfast. I would definitely stay here again if needed to.Dear DALANIERMICHIGAN,Thank you for taking the time review your stay at the Best Western San Diego/Miramar. Were happy to hear that our hotel suited your needs. As you mentioned, we are located near the freeway with easy access to the I-15, were delighted to hear that was convenient for you. Once more, thank you for reviewing the Best Western San Diego/Miramar. We hope to see you again in the near future.
1377	2	NOt a cheap stay in sd but I'll chalk that up to summertime. Hotel or should I say motel needs a remodel. Elevator reeks of urine. Rooms loOked clean enough until I looked in the bath tub where some brown mystery substances resided. Bedding had blond hairs, mine are brown! Fridge very loud kept me up all night. Price paid was to much for quality!Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for investing some time in reviewing the Best Western Plus Miramar. We also thank you for expressing your concerns to us so that we can continue to strive to work hard in providing guests with quality guest service and well maintained rooms that are above brand standards. To hear all the inconvenience that was caused during your stay is disheartening to us. Please know that your concerns are being addressed with our staff so that we are able to improve our services to future guests. Thank you again for reviewing the Best Western Plus Miramar.
1378	5	pre stay info was excellent. check-in was easy. nice clean rooms. best western picked up half the tab for the taxi to the va- la- jolla. I had spine surgery with dr. janni at the va . all went well . I would recommend them to any or all vets. oh, also the breakfast provided was diverse and excellentDear Guest, We are so delighted to hear that your recent stay with us at the Best Western Sam Diego Miramar was excellent!

Thank you for allowing us to give back to you as a Veteran and we hope a swift recovery for you. We appreciate you taking the time to review your stay with us!
1379	5	Our stay in this hotel was extended considerably by car trouble and the staff went out of their way to insure that our stay was pleasant. The entire staff, from the General Manager to our housekeeper, gave us 5 Star serviceDear TexasCajun46Thank you for taking the time to place a review for the hotel. We appreciate you feedback. Ah, I am sad to hear that you had car troubles while you were at our hotel, but I am glad to hear that we were able to accommodate you while you dealing with your car issues. I will let all of our staff know about your good comments. Hope that you do not have anymore car issues. Thanks for staying with us.
1380	3	Staff very helpful - stayed 9 days. Pool very clean - any problems were corrected. Internet touch and go on first floor, but 2nd floor and up fine. Rooms are older, but for the price it was about average. Location was excellent. Delivery for food was available, and we took advantage of it. Right next door in a Carl's Hamburg Restaurant, which also served breakfast - came in handy if you were too late for the Best Western free breakfast (by the way, waffles were great and the lady in charge was fabulous).Dear Randi J, Thank you for providing feedback regarding your stay at the Best Western San Diego/Miramar. We are thrilled to hear our staff is very helpful. We strive in providing our guests with excellent quality service and are touched you took notice. AS you mentioned, we do offer complimentary breakfast and are delighted you were able to enjoy it during your stay. We hope to see you again, during your next trip to San Diego. Once more, thank you for reviewing the Best Western San Diego/Miramar.
1381	4	We stayed here for the Miramar Air Show this past month and loved it. Picture this, record hot temps in SD, up to my neck in the pool and the Blue Angels flying overhead. Yep. Breakfast was good, hotel was clean, nice, all the things you would ask for. Our room was located on the opposite side of where the air show was and it was very quiet, although we definitely wouldn't have minded being on the airshow side. Would definitely stay here again.Dear h20lover, Thank you for taking the time in reviewing the Best Western Plus San Diego/Miramar. We are delighted to hear you had a wonderful stay at our hotel. We work hard in providing our guests with a memorable experience and are so pleased to have accomplished said task. As you mentioned, we are located near Miramar and are thrilled you were able to enjoy the airshow from our pool, during such a heat wave. We look forward to your next night with us and appreciate your feedback regarding the Best Western Plus San Diego/Miramar.
1382	5	The Hotel staff was very accommodating. I was there for a business meeting the next day and I accidentally booked a smoking room, but wanted a non-smoking room. Manu, was a big help and got me into a non-smoking room for the night at the same rate. The room was clean, and everything worked as it was intended. I was also pleased with the quality of the complementary breakfast. I will definitely stay with them again.Thank you for your feedback regarding your stay at the Best Western San Diego Miramar. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us and glad to hear that Manu was able to accommodate you to a non-smoking room. Our staff is always working hard to make sure that you provide cleans rooms, welcoming staff and to make sure that the everything is working properly in the room. Thank you for choosing our hotel and we will see you in your future bookings.
1383	2	The room was adequate but the breakfast was terrible. First the space is under construction. There is no room to sit. They did not keep the food stocked. So if you came late there wasn't much to eat. The hotel was overpriced for the condition it is in at the moment. Find another place to stay.Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for investing your time in reviewing our hotel. We appreciate your feedback and concerns, as they are significantly valuable to us. We do apologize about the inconvenience that was caused during your stay. Please know that these issues are being addressed with our staff so that we can improve our amenities and service to future guests. We hope that you would be so kind as to give us another chance and stay with us again, in the future. Thank you again for reviewing our hotel.
1384	3	Friendly staff, average looking hotel, clean room. We got there way before our check in time because of an early flight but the staff was considerate and was able to get us check into a room right away.Dear Anahit A, Thank you for providing feedback regarding your stay at the Best Western San Diego/Miramar. We are thrilled to hear we have friendly staff at our hotel. We work hard in providing our guests with excellent quality service and are touched you took notice. As you mentioned, we do offer early check-ins when available and are delighted to have been able to accommodate your early arrival. We hope to see you again, during your next trip to San Diego. Once more, thank you for reviewing the Best Western San Diego/Miramar.
1385	1	I had booked a reservation through Priceline.com for a non-smoking room. When I arrived at the hotel I was informed succinctly that my reservation came through for a smoking room. Although there were non-smoking rooms available, I was charged 11 to change to a non-smoking room. Calls from customer service agents at Priceline had no effect at all. The front desk clerk admitted to me that this happens very frequently (every day she said) to people who book through Priceline or Hotwire. I believe this hotel is running a scam to earn extra revenue by charging unsuspecting customers extra money for non-smoking rooms. Shameful. I will never stay there again.Let me start by thanking you for completing our Guest Survey regarding your recent stay at our property. I apologize for not exceeding your expectations. We strive to ensure each and every guest experience is satisfying. Please know that we are taking your feedback to heart and focusing on improving. As you know when you buy your room through hotwire / priceline with name your price you are giving up lot of prevallage, such as choice of your hotel, room type ect. This type of booking channel will give you deep discount but any guest request is subject to availabity, if we don't have same room type we offer guest choice to upgrade to diffrent room type and pay the diffrence (once again this upgrade is subject to availability). I advice if guest has specific need please book through Bestwestern.com and select room type of their need. Each room type and rates are clearly explain. Again, I apologize for the inconvenience during your stay and hope to see you during your next visit.
1386	4	Came down to see the granddaughter play in a volleyball tournament. The hotel is within a reasonable distance from the site of Alliant U campus. The hotel was clean, the beds were extremely comfortable, and the towels were the best (softest and dried better) than any other we have had this year. Almost like home. The internet connected easily, but the desk provided in our room was small and the only light hung above in the ceiling. The chair provided was not an office type chair, unable to adjust the height. This made internet use a bit more difficult. Breakfast was normal for a Best Western. We chose to go to the IHop just across the street instead for more variety. And that was an experience in itself - a positive one. Overall it was a great price for San Diego. The room was more than adequate for our purposes. And our room was quiet and dark enough. Hate the taxes in San Diego for visitors. Seems to be a growing trend, soak the tourists.Dear Joel,Thank you for investing the time to review your stay with us. Were thrilled to hear that our hotel suited your needs. Our staff holds guest service in the highest regard and were pleased to hear that you were left with a memorable experience. As you mentioned, we are centrally located near local universities and colleges, were happy to hear that was of convenience for you. Again, thank you for reviewing our hotel, we look forward to seeing you again in the near future.
1387	3	Over priced compared to where we stayed the night before. We stayed at Hotel Karlan-san Diego double tree by Hilton for 7 more on a Saturday. We stayed here on Sunday. First room had a blown outlet, with no power to night stand wall. Manager moved us into another room. (Thank you)Then, second room smelled like stail air. Took awhile to vent out. Shower drain was clogged, and had to wash down some small spiders.Staff was very nice. Dear Down99Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel. I am sorry to hear that the 1st room had a blown outlet but I am glad to see that you were moved for the issue to be resolved. It looks like the reset was not enough to fix the issue. We are not pleased to hear that the second room air smelled stail. That is not what we want our rooms to smell like. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed our staff here at the hotel.Thank you for staying for staying with us and I am sorry about the electrical issues you had at the hotel.
1388	5	It's been a while since I was here and this property has been upgraded! Very nice! Nice rooms, improved breakfast area, pool and jacuzzi with lots of seats. Rooms are clean and spacious with fridge and microwave. There is a gas station and Carl's junior next to hotel. Dear Carole W,Thank you for taking the time in reviewing the Best Western San Diego/Miramar. As you mentioned, we went through a recent renovation and are ecstatic that you took notice. We always aim to leave our guests with a positive experience and are so happy we were able to do just that. Thank you again for reviewing the Best Western San Diego/Miramar. We look forward to seeing you during your next stay.
1389	5	This is the third time I have stayed here, as it fits all my needs. A lovely well-kept hotel in the Sandhills of Nebraska (which were all green and gorgeous from recent rains). Extremely clean and quiet rooms with comfy beds. Really enjoyed the huge breakfast buffet, too! Finally, a place where the bacon is neverending!
1390	5	We stayed here on August 28th, 2015. The rooms were really nice and comfortable. If we ever get back to this area we will definitely stay here again. It is walking distance to several restaurants. This a plus if you are tired from driving.
1391	4	Good hotel, definitely better than average. A great place to stop on the way to Colorado. Breakfast was good. Wish they had more dining options in North Platte, but hey, it's a travel town. The beds are comfy. It's a bit pricy, but the Marriott name adds security.
1392	5	I stayed at the Fairfield Inn at North Platte during a recent trip out west. The hotel, right off of I-80, was spotless and very welcoming. The check in staff had everything in order when I arrived and after only a few moments I was on my way to my room. The room was spacious, clean very well appointed.... More
1393	3	I enjoyed being on the 12th, top floor, for the views. Yes, the single semi operating elevator was a chore. Room was average and not totally clean. Desk and table tops were not all that clean in that there were sticky spills remaining. Connecting restaurant offered very nice evening meals at good prices. Breakfast in the same restaurant wasaverage but expected per the usual expectations for BW. The always present tip jar. I do tip but do not care for the begging bowl. Does not seem classy. TV so, so. No Fox News. Bias There is a plus for this hotel and that is the staff. Well staffed, helpful and friendly.
1394	4	I spent a fun weekend with several friends at this hotel. It was in a great location. We could walk to the Gaslamp and Little Italy sections of San Diego in a matter of minutes. Shuttle from the airport to the hotel started out a little shaky when we had to wait an hour for pick up, but the very friendly driver made up for it. He even gave us a ride to a tour location so we would not miss it due to our late arrival. The room was clean and the morning breakfast was great! Our room had a great view of the bay. I would definitely stay here again!
1395	4	Abbiamo soggiornato 2 notti durante il nostro viaggio di nozze. Siamo stati un po' sfortunati sia per la camera, solo al secondo piano e vista strada sia per il fatto che dei lavori, indipendenti dall'hotel, hanno comportato l'interruzione della corrente per quasi tutta una notte. Nonostante questo il personale stato efficiente e disponibile offrendoci torce ed avvisando tutti con l'interfono in stanza di quando ci sarebbe stata l'interruzione. La stanza era grande e pulita, l'aria condizionata molto funzionale e finalmente silenziosa. Maggiore rispetto ad altri hotel la disponibilit di prodotti da bagno. Disponibilit di un grande frigorifero e di un forno a microonde. Ottimo il sonno, non si sentiva un rumore. La colazione era la classica continentale, buona ma migliorabile con pi scelte. Il parcheggio dell'hotel comodissimo e costa solo (non vi dico i prezzi che ho trovato a Chicago, Los Angeles o San Francisco) 14 a notte e noi l'abbiamo sfruttato a pieno. Abbiamo anche potuto usare un PC per gli ospiti. WiFi gratis e piuttosto veloce. Ottima la posizione centrale. Insomma difficile chiedere di pi. Consigliato!!Dear DanieleC8, Thank you for choosing to stay at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn during your trip to San Diego! We are pleased you felt the rooms are large, clean and the AC unit is quite. Thank you for your feedback about the 33 minute power shutdown while SDGE updated service in the downtown area and that our staff provided flashlights. We value the details you shared about your breakfast experience this information helps us continue to focus the growth of our buffet options for our guests. Thank you for your recommendation, we hope to have the opportunity to accommodate you again! Best Regards,Grace GerzenGuest Relations Manager
1396	5	We stayed for 2 nights and would love to go back. We were travelling with a tour and on arrival the hotel served us with a drink and fresh fruit and cheese and biscuits. I thought this was a lovely touch. We had breakfast each morning and got plenty. The staff were very friendly and the rooms were clean and comfortable. This hotel is right near the waterfront and there is lots to do nearby. I loved San Diego and would love to go back some day. I will stay here if I do.Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn during your trip to San Diego. We are pleased you enjoyed the reception for your group in our Bayside Bar Grill Restaurant. Thank you for your kind words about our staff and rooms. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future. Best RegardsGrace GerzenGuest Relations Manager
1397	5	Great place to stay, rooms had everything you would need in a nights stay. Clean, quiet and great views from either side of the building. And most important it was close to Amtrak, airport, the bay, gas lamp, freeway, Petco Park and a Rite aid to buy your beer. Will visit again.Dear Anthony P, Thank you for staying with us at the Best Western Plus Bayside Inn during your trip to San Diego. We are pleased to see that you enjoyed your stay with us and want to thank you for taking time to share so many details about your trip. We are happy to have provided you with a location near so much. We look forward to your next visit. Best Regards,Grace GerzenGuest Relations Manager
1398	4	all you would expect at a good hotel. The building is old but well kept , has a nice convenient parking garage and breakfast room. The thermostat is a bit tricky at times ---ask for help at the desk to be sure you operate it properly.Thank you for staying at BW PLUS Bayside Inn. We are pleased you found our parking to be convenient and enjoyed the complimentary breakfast buffet too. Thank you for your feedback in regards to the thermostat and we appreciate your kind words about our well kept hotel.
1399	5	Prior to our flight out of San Diego we stayed at another almost twice as expense hotel. My wife suggested that when we returned we stay at a Best Western as we have usually had a good experience with them at a much reduced price plus the membership and other money saving features are great. We checked into the Best Western Plus Bayside Inn and frankly were surprised on how nice it was as a reasonable price. Very clean entrance, plenty of parking, shuttle service and from the airport, train station, etc., breakfast included, dinner discounted 15 in their comfortable restaurant. A great complete menu and excellent service! Our room was on the 8th floor ocean view so we could see the bay and the square rigger Star of India along side the dock. Would recommend you get at least a 4th floor but higher is better. We had two queen sized beds which were very comfortable. An approximately 40 flat screen tv, coffee maker, microwave, refrigerator, ironing board and iron, hair drier, nice bathroom and fixtures. A small but usable balcony, internet service, desk and two chairs, closet, etc. ATM in lobby. Ice machines on 3rd, 6th 9th 12th floor. Vending machines in lobby. Late check-out service up to 4 PM which on top of a 12 o'clock usual check out time is fantastic for travelers! The smoking rooms are all on the 4th floor which made us happy. In other words at a very reasonable price one gets a lot of appreciated features. Apparently people from around the world have found it as we met a lot of people from Germany, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, etc. It is just a few blocks from the water front and from the train station and about a mile from the airport so walking is practical.Dear lucklady15,Thank you so much for your positive review of our property. It pleases us greatly that you enjoyed your stay with us. We try to provide as many amenities as possible for our guests so that they feel at home while they are traveling, so we are glad that you were able to take advantage of and enjoy these amenities. We hope that if your future travels bring you back to San Diego, you will once again choose to stay with us at the Bayside Inn.
1400	4	I stayed for four nights. The staff is great. The room is not up to date furnishings but very functional and everything is clean and solid. The bathroom was spotless. I had a suite with so much space, a couch, desk, fridge, coffeemaker, comfortable chair, good internet and large tv with good cable package. The breakfast is basic (pancakes, scrambled eggs, sausages, plus assorted breads, cereals, juices, coffees and so on) but the ingredients are all fresh and taste good. Their restaurant is very nice, the staff just incredibly friendly with actual good service. Plus the dinners were good deals for the price. There is a smaller room of a fitness center, but there is a treadmill, cross-trainer etc. and equipment feels new and the room is well designed with all the details. Didn't use the pool and jacuzzi this trip. The hotel is located in a quiet section of downtown, which is great concerning noise, but means walking a good 15 min to get to either Gaslamp area or any direction really. A car makes sense in this area. The train station is nearby as well, but the hotel was nice enough to offer a free ride to it on our check-out day. The only issue ahead is a corner now just finished digging for a new condo building. Once that gets up in floors it may be noisy for a while. But now now.
1401	3	Location is the draw for this hotel. It has been remolded and is clean. For the price it was a disappointing. We were first given a room next to an elevator and overlooking the parking garage, we requested a room away from the elevator and were given a room next to the parking garage. The bed was good, TV was large, hot water was very very hot, watch out for this.Nice breakfast hot and cold choices.We were there on a weekend and there was no close place to have a libation after a long trip. The city is pretty quiet in this area during the weekend.However, you can walk to Little Italy and I'm sure there is refreshment there. I had not realized there would be a fourteen dollar charge per night parking and a required twenty dollar deposit for incidentals, usually hotels just ask to use the credit card on file--I think it was just the way they verbalized this that made me wonder. Great shuttle service to our harbor dinner cruise. Friendly driver, saved us from the hassle of finding and paying for parking..
1402	4	This place is a fantastic deal. It seems like the common areas have recently been renovated. The staff was absolutely wonderful and the amenities are pretty good. There is a hot tub, heated pool, fitness center, and continental breakfast. The breakfast was pretty standard, nothing special. My only complaint about this place is the cramped parking lot with no elevators. Otherwise my family and I truly enjoyed our stay and felt very comfortable here. I would definitely recommend it!
1403	4	We recently stayed at this hotel for the first time, and will return again in June. The location can't be beat, and the hotel was just fine for our needs. We had a king bed room on the first floor (our choice), which was clean and well equipped. The room was a bit worn, but nothing too major. The included... More
1404	5	Very good place to stay. Staff was very professional and friendly. Would recommend this place to anyone travelling to Washington, North Carolina
1405	3	My friend found this hotel and we were looking for a good price and good location in NYC for 4 nights in October. This hotel is as expensive and so much smaller than where we stayed in Paris in Trocadero a year ago. This room is so small. We have two double beds,each up against the wall. There is 2 feet at the foot of the bed to the table, closet and desk. The bathroom barely fits a sink, toilet and shower/bath. I have never been in such a small room at a Holiday Inn Express. I can not imagine trying to fit 4 people into this room.Dear Julie H,Thank you for sharing your recent experience with us! We really appreciate you choosing our hotel for your accommodation needs. We apologize for failing to meet your expectations during your stay and are disappointed in ourselves for allowing you to leave unsatisfied. We realize, being in NYC, our property differs from those in less metropolitan areas. This must have come as a surprise to you and we apologize if this negatively impacted your stay. Although we respect your decision to lodge elsewhere, we would be honored to have you as our guest again in the future. Again, thank you for staying with us and we wish you the best in your travels! Sincerely,Team Holiday Inn Express Times Square
1406	4	Stayed just for one night at the end of a recent business trip to USA.Paid USD 20 extra for a city view and wow it was well worth it to be 36 floors up - what a view.Slightly strange as there just a handful of rooms on each floor, but all was OK.Room not the biggest but had all I needed. Might be a squash for two of you, especially if you were staying for a longer time.Concierge VERY helpful - French guy I think - sorry name forgotten :(Perfect central location - just a stone's throw from Times Square - but quiet too.Breakfast typical Express style - not outstanding but tasty enough and plenty of choice.Pretty sure that I will be back!Good Day,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel and share some of your thoughts about your stay with us. If you are ever back in the area we look forward to serving you again in the future! Frank Cortese,General Manager
1407	5	Room was pretty standard for New York and the price was very good. Loved the free internet access and breakfast that was included. Bathroom was good sized and the shower was very comfortable in size. I found the bed to be very comfortable and I slept great. I am pretty low maintenance so I did not have much contact with the front desk except for chick-in and check-out. Both experiences were quick and easy.My room was low but on the inside so it was very quiet. I slept great every night I spent there.The only downside to my visit was that the fitness facility is in an adjacent property. The temps were frigid so I was not keen on going outside to access the fitness center. as a result, I skipped my workouts.Dear SBolin,Thank you for posting your review on tripadvisor. I was very pleased to hear your comments on how you enjoyed our hotel, staff and loved the complimentary breakfast. We look forward to welcoming you again to the Holiday Inn Express Time Square.Best Regards,Team Holiday Inn Express Time Square
1408	2	The efforts of some of the staff were good - but they lack enough power to persuade me to return and thus why it received a poor instead of a terribleThe Staff:Hunter the manager - was great (sadly we had to get to know him through complaints) - a true professional, and provided exactly what I expected from a hotel manager.The maintenance guys(he had brades) - an honest, down to earth person - good service.The breakfast - is good and better than what I expected and was happy about thatThe breakfast staff was friendly and no complaints.The front desk staff the very happy guy at the front desk was the saviour of the reception staff the rest were less than impressive.The cleaning staff is as rude as you can get - especially the ones that dont speak English - they have very aggressive tones, the ones that can speak English are very argumentative.The Location: The location of the hotel was good - since this was my first trip to NYC its hard to be definite on this - the one thing that is awesome, is that its around the corner from a dollar pizza shop ( the exit of the hotel, turn right and then right again at the lights and its on the next corner - go past the dry cleaning shop)The Rooms:Room 1:Blood drops on the floor that had been dripped from the bed to the bathroom.Room 1 and Room 2 - had 2 double beds - ledge walking is the preferred method of movement because the rooms are that small.Room 2 bath sink hole was so clogged with hair and no-one had cleaned it and the poor maintenance guy had to clean it with pliers and plungers.I can honestly say, the elevator is half the size of the bedroom.
1409	4	This was really a nice find in NYC. The price was great, excellent value for money. The included breakfast was quite a spread. Room was small but clean. Staff at front desk very friendly and helpful. They were willing to keep our bags before check in and after we checked out, so a big help when you want to do the touristy thing. Could not get a better location for the price, one block away from Port Authority.Dear Janette V,Thank you for your great review of the Holiday Inn Express Time Square. Its so nice you have highlighted our great location, accommodation and service.Hope to welcome you back soon.Best Regards,Team Holiday Inn Express Time Square
1410	5	We only stayed at this hotel for 1 night, but it was definitely worth it. First of all, all hotels in NYC are ridiculously expensive, so be prepared to shell out at least 200-250 for this hotel, and it will be one of the cheapest finds. It is perfectly situated about 3 blocks from times squre, so you are close to the action, but can get a good night's sleep. The front desk was very nice and helpful. They gave us a map, and showed us where we were located, and explained how the subway system worked. We arrived earlier than the checkin time, and our room was ready which was GREAT. For check out, our train was departing at 11:00 p.m., and they were nice enough to store our luggage while we toured the city. We had to print out our Broadway tickets from Ticketmaster, and it only took 3 minutes in the business center, where the internet and print outs were free.I would definitely stay again in this hotel.Dear Mariana L,Thank you so much for the great review and we hope you had a terrific time here in NYC! Its great to see you enjoyed our location and amenities. We really hope this experience encouraged you to stay with us again in the future as we look forward to your return. Thanks again for the kind feedback and we wish you the best in your travels!Sincerely,Team Holiday Inn Express Times Square
1411	4	The location of Holiday Inn Express on 39th near 9th Ave served my wife and I very well. We're a mid-40's couple on our first visit to Manhattan and in a three-day period were able to enjoy a wide array of sites and activities with Holiday Inn Express as our hub. The hotel is quaint (teenie tiny) and the limited space made the atmosphere very family oriented...you got to know your floor mates and people at the daily breakfast.We didn't take advantage of a specific view, so our 7th floor room looked over new construction on (we believe) on 38th. Elevator service is slow in this location, and, as expected, wasn't convenient during high-traffic times, so we adjusted our schedule a little. The lower floor customers appeared to use the stairs with more frequency. Staff is average...they enjoyed one another's company, and we're business-like with patrons. We did not use Concierge assistance, but notice the desk was manned regularly.Greetings Wyantabouttown,Thank you for providing us with your feedback on TripAdvisor. We are pleased to know that you enjoyed your stay by using our hotel as your hub close to all major attractions. As well as, that you felt at home at our hotel by making new friends. Once again, thank you and we hope to see you and your wife soon!
1412	4	When going to Times Square, I always arrive from Penn station (from Newark airport, best ans ceapest way by train).This hotel sits right in the middle between Penn and TS. Only there for a short stay, the rooms are nothing to write to your mother about, however. Quite small. Furnitures were not meant to fit in that kind of room. Reminds me of Japan lolStaff is vey professionnal, however did not try as hard as I would have expected to meet my small requests. Breakfast was good, but the set-up again is all packed in a little area. But this is NYC prime location. And the price is very affodble. and You are not here to stay in the room. So, I recommend this hotel if you are an IHC fan. I'll stay there again.Dear expatsing,Thank you for posting your review of our Holiday Inn Express Times Square. I am glad our location was convenient to your needs. We apologize if our rooms were not what you were expecting. Although all of our rooms are the same size, we should have better communicated that to you so you didnt feel we were not helpful in offering you the most comfortable accommodations. We thank you for recommending us in trip advisor and hope when you return you will be able to experience a more comfortable stay. Yours in Hospitality,Team Holiday Inn Express Time Square
1413	5	I was there on Friday night. I work for IHG so I was there on an employee stay. The check in was a little slow due to the front desk agent dealing with a difficult guest. Our check in was quick because being a night auditor I know check in procedures and IHG reward standards. I was happy they gave my request for 2 beds as well as a decent view! The room was super clean. Only minor issue was that there was no garbage bags in the room. I used the laundry bag instead. Great job staff at HIE Times Square. :)Dear taylorma05,5-stars from someone who knows hospitality - wow thank you so much! I'm happy to hear that we were able to meet your request and that your room was very clean. I will share all of your comments with my team so we can continue to focus on cleanliness and service!
1414	4	The hotel was just what we were looking for close to subway stations, shops, restaurants and a few blocks from Times Square. Set close to the fashion district, it may not be based in the busiest of streets, but after long day, sight-seeing or visiting friends. It was a place, my friend and I, were proud to call home for 5 days. When we arrived in New York, it was good to see Jamie smiling and helping us out in reception.The staff were very freindly and nothing was too much bother. Breakfast was a good kick start in the morning, and complimentary web access was avaialble near reception, to look up places for the day ahead.Before booking the hotel I had read reviews, that rooms at this hotel are small, that maybe so. However, although they are quite small, they give you everything you need for a comfortable stay. Good beds, a tv, desk area and a compact bathroom with shower and bath.We definately look forward to returning here in the future. Its clean, comfortable and friendly. What more do you need.
1415	4	My room was very comfortable with the exception of the bathroom. More counter space was needed and the faucets were located too far back from the edge of the sink therefore, when the water was turned on to wash your hands or face, water went all over the sink. That was very annoying. Dear mcneisgs, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience about your recent stay at our hotel. You are among our most valued guests. We sincerely appreciate your feedback and we are very sorry we did not exceed your expectations concerning our bathrooms. Your comments will help us as we continually work to improve our guest experience. We hope you will consider staying with us again in the future. At Hilton Garden Inn, we promise to do whatever it takes to ensure you are satisfied. You Can Count On Us. Guaranteed.Sincerely, Sammie.
1416	5	Great size room! Very clean and modern. Loved the shower. Would've liked a room further away from the elevators since walls are super thin and you can hear everyone walking by and slamming doors! Overall good hotel and a great stay!Dear 883anelr,Thank you for taking the time to share your experience about your recent stay at our hotel. We know how important a good nights sleep is and I sincerely apologize for the noise issue encountered during your stay. I will address your feedback with our team. If there is anything else I can do for you at this time, please contact me. We hope you will consider staying with us again in the future. Our goal is to make your stay better and brighter. Sincerely, Sammie
1417	5	This hotel was recently renovated and they did an awesome job. Updated and modern yet welcoming and comfortable. Since I was there on business I didn't use the pool or work out facility, but the bar and restaurant is fantastic...everyone is super friendly. Walking distance to an amazing Italian restaurant and gas station for quick provisions if need be. Thumbs up!Dear Kara M C,Thank you for your kind words and feedback, we truly appreciate all of your comments! I am pleased to hear that you like the new design of our remodel and that you were able to enjoy our restaurant/bar as well as the nearby provisions. We hope that you decide to return for another visit any time you are in the area! We would love to become one of your usual places when your commute brings you down to San Diego!Sincerely,Sammie
1418	4	Overall evaluation was very good. Stayed here to be close to the stadium for a football game. A recent renovation made for some nice rooms with modern amenities. My only complaint was the parking. It's limited and if the have any groups at the hotel then you're parking in side streets. When I was there they had the parking garage closed for steam cleaning and striping. Had to walk in from very dark side streets each night...not a safe situation. They wanted to still charge for parking each night even when we parked off site. Overall a good visit, great rooms and staff.Dear YankeeOne,Thank you so much for taking the time to leave a review about your recent stay with us. I sincerely apologize for the difficult parking situation that you experienced while staying with us. Your feedback is greatly appreciated as we are continuously striving to better our guests' experience. I am so happy to hear that your overall experience was still a pleasant one. We look forward to serving you again in the future! :)Sincerely,Sammie
1419	3	Came here for an overnighter. As HHonors members, we got the smallest odd room 239, an angled room with an unsightly view of the buildings rooftop equipment. Walls were very thin so we could here the people next door talking and watching tv. Was not a bad experience but was not a great one either. The room was nice but cramp. Microwave and fridge in the room but was not used. Not bad for overnight but go somewhere else if you intend to stsy for a long weekend. I thought as a HHonors i would get just a bit better room but thats not the case. I stayed at a Hilton property near this one also about 3weeks prior and again, i got one if the worst rooms with the worst view of homeless people outside our window. HHonors doesn't jack to us. Dear 53wohoo,Thank you for taking the time to provided feedback about your recent stay with us. We strive to make every guests' stay a pleasant one from check-in to departure through quality service and amenities, and we regret this was not your impression. We will use your comments as part of our ongoing service training and hope you will give us another opportunity to show you the quality stay you deserve should you return to our area in the future.Sincerely,Sammie
1420	5	Short get away and first time at hotel. Enjoyed stay and easy in and out and close to elevators. Parking first time in was somewhat confusing but overall ok once seeing overall structure. We always enjoy the high standard of Hilton hotelsDear U4720JRjimw,Thank you for your kind words and feedback, we truly appreciate all of your comments! We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your experience at our location. We hope that you decide to return for another visit any time you are in the area! We would love to become one of your usual places when your commute brings you down to San Diego!Sincerely, Sammie
1421	3	Depending on your needs this hotel is fine. The pluses are that it is recently remodeled and the dinner menu is really nice and that food is good. The negatives are the breakfast buffet is really anemic, not like any other Hilton Garden Inn I've stayed at before. The parking is awful and expensive, I did not notice that there was a fee for parking on the website but it might have been there. The hotel, for having been recently remodeled, is clean, the rooms were a little less clean.Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to provide us with valuable feedback about your recent stay with us. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience of the breakfast buffet and the parking fee. Parking is a premium in San Diego and we charge this fee to ensure we are able to guarantee a safe and secure parking space for our hotel guests. We do make sure to post it on all of our websites as it is not our goal to catch our guests by surprise with this extra fee. I am glad to see that you were happy with the overall accommodations and service that you received! If there is anything else that I may do for you at this time please feel free to reach out to me.Sincerely, Sammie,
1422	4	Its was great I will recommend this to other people. Once they finish upgrading the lobby it will even be better. The room and the fitness center was very clean.. They even had earphone for you to listen the the music or television so no one could hear it.Dear William W,Thank you for your kind words and feedback! We truly appreciate all of your comments! We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your experience at our location. We wish to see you soon. At Hilton Garden Inn, we promise to do whatever it takes to ensure you are satisfied. You Can Count On Us. Guaranteed.Sincerely,Sammie
1423	5	If you are looking to vacation with your family or just need a place to stay I highly recommend this hotel. The service was amazing. The room was super clean and comfortable. Parking was not bad and both elevators worked. Dear gloriachernandez23, Thank you for your kind words and feedback, we truly appreciate all of your comments! We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your experience at our location. We hope that you decide to return for another visit any time you are in the area! We would love to become one of your usual places when your commute brings you down to San Diego!Sammie Chapman
1424	3	This was the only Hotel that we made reservations for in our trip. We got in a little early, about 1:10 and were told the rooms were not ready. We had to come back after 2 PM. When I made reservations they said there was a 15.00 pet fee. When we got there they wanted to charge us 25.00 for... More
1425	5	The staff was courteous and friendly. The hotel is located near I-95, I-395, and I-495 intersection. But the noise level is not a problem. The breakfast buffet is very nice and dining area pleasant. We enjoyed our long weekend stay here.Thank you for taking the time to comment on your recent experience at the Best Western Springfield. We appreciate your patronage and feedback as we strive to lead the industry in customer care. At your service. Imran Ali AGM
1426	4	We have stayed here numerous times when it was a Super 8 and just stayed there again this past holiday weekend after it changed to Pinckneyville Inn. The rooms are clean, the staff is friendly, the pool is a huge plus and it is very affordable. We will defiantly be staying here again in the future!
1427	4	The property was extremely clean, no rust in the showers, i had a double bed non smoking room, the beds were small, but it was comfortable. The front desk clerk named Chelz was very personable, and she went above and beyond! Thank You Again Chelz. My baby Loved the swimming pool, and the work out facility.
1428	3	This inn is in the process of being redone. The front desk people were very nice and very accommodating. The room was clean and comfortable. parking is by the room door. Old television. No breakfast. Has microwave and fridge.
1429	5	Thank you Best Western Staff, especially Lindsey and Mike. Awesome customer service, you helped return my daughter's school laptop. My daughter did not notice until 2 days later she forgot her laptop at the hotel. We called the hotel and worked with Mike to recover the laptop. He had additional help and we are so greatful they found the laptop.Honest... More
1430	3	Outside of building and location was decent. Not too far from the Mall of America. Decent room rate for that area. Front desk area was acceptable. Hallway was narrow, dark, and smelled. Room was recently remodeled and nice minus the leaking faucet in the tub. Dogs welcome which is nice, but a dog peed on the floor in the font... More
1431	5	We needed an affordable park and stay for an extended trip (our son got married in Mexico!) and this Super 8 met those needs perfectly. It covered the amount of days we required and gave us a beginning and end point before traveling again, which was also perfect! It took the stress off of rushing and allowed us to relax... More
1432	4	This was a very clean nice room. The hotel staff was very pleasant. I would high recommend staying here if you are in the area. Bathroom and shower were very clean and everything worked well I had a great overall experience
1433	1	While the outside is what draws in the crowd, the restaurants and snazzy bars keep the walkers inside, once you put that key card into the door, and go rest to relax, you quickly realize the executive suite that you booked, is nothing more than a run down Motel. Taking away from the fact my reservation was for a King,... More
1434	1	The hotel is in a wonderful location near the river. Unfortunately, they have too many issues. The rooms are outdated and many of the basic features (outlets, dresser drawers, phones) did not work. The food was consistently cold and of poor quality. Most importantly, the customer service was exceptionally poor throughout the entire facility.
1435	4	Stayed at this hotel for the 3rd time. Every time I am in Louisville, this is where I stay. Why Because it is located near the river (great views), it is close to all things down town and it has indoor access to the sports arena. The Atrium area for just relaxing is comfortable and well suited for a nice... More
1436	5	Personnel during our weekend were just great, esp. Ashley Front Desk offering suggestions and answering every single question. NOW! it is difficult to navigate with two towers but, once you get the zoop that the 3rd floor is the skyway - OK / plus, the parking garage is not an EZ lay-out and the schlep to the lobby on... More
1437	3	Checking in sucks because you can't leave your car. You have to find the parking garage first, don't miss your turn or you will have to find your way back on the one-way streets. Then once you park, get ready for a dirty elevator ride, but to which floor. The labels are messed up. Then once check in, which was... More
1438	4	Stay in this hotel for one night because of a business meeting close-by.Pros:1. Free Wi-Fi and wire internet connection with reasonably connection speed. 2. Though the fitness room is small, it does equip with enough equipments for a great workout.3. Breakfast is nice, especially on the cook-to-order omelette.4. The lobby has recently been reinnovated, which looks very nice and makes you feel at home.5. There is a complimentary shuttle to anywhere within 5-mile radius. It's excellent.Cons:1. My room is on 2nd floor but it's just above the swimming pool. There was a party during the night that would make you feel very annoyed because of the noise.2. The A/C is quite loudy.
1439	5	I was travelling alone and was given excellent driving and walking directions. The room was quiet and comfortable. I wasn't able to take advantage of the pool or other amenities, but was very pleased with the staff and the hotel. Would recommend to family and friends in the future.Thank you for recommending us to your family and friends. We look forward to delivering an exceptional experience to you again in the future, and hope fully you will get a dip in the pool next time!
1440	5	This was a meeting point for a friend's sons wedding. Our first impression was the super helpful and well trained staff. Our second floor room was full of surprises. Window opens fully letting in tons of fresh air. Nice bathroom with a spacious shower and tons of hot water. The biggest surprise was the king bed which had firmness adjustments. I slept like a baby while there. There is a nice bar for sharing some great laughs. The dining room serves a pretty basic but nice breakfast buffet. We had a marvelous dinner while there that was moderately priced. Overall this is a great place to use while visiting San Diego. Sleep is essential, especially when you have a weekend packed full of wedding fun! Hopefully we will see you back for another wedding soon! Thank you!
1441	5	I have been travel to this hotel.. M-Thur.. for last seven weeks (road-warrior) and I cannot say enough good things about this hotel and the people that work here... but I will take a shot at it!When you get in, you get a warm and courteous staff that greets you and gets you checked in. Once I am settled in, I usually go downstairs for food and drinks - highly recommend Grilled Salmon, Grilled Veg Pasta Primavera and BBQ Ribs. Of course they have Stone IPA on tap which save me a 12 miles trip to the actual brewer (still go check it out!). The bartenders (shoutout to Rodalyn and Boryana) are fun and engaging.. its never a dull moment with these two gals. For morning breakfast buffet, get the egg-white omelette with scallion, spinach, mushroom and green peppers... not sure why but it taste fantastic when they make it here!! The staff here has always been highly responsive to my needs and are a delight to be around.Last but not least, the management of hotel, especially Shane, has been absolute delight to work with. I travel every week and there have been couple of weeks were I thought I had booked the hotel room and had completely forgotten to... and yet with one phone call, he has helped me get it squared away EVER SINGLE TIME. He has figured out a way to make it happen even when situation seemed dire. Eighth week now and counting... I highly recommend this hotel to both casual travelers as well as my fellow road-warriors! For me, it is home away from home.Sharing your review with the online community is the best compliment you can give our team! Shane, Rodalyn and Boryana, live and breathe hospitality. They make the experience. I will be sure to share your positive feedback with them. Thank you so much for your loyal support and we will be waiting for you on your next stay.
1442	4	We have stayed here for several years. While the decor could use some updating, our overall stay was excellent.It was quiet and the breakfasts are very good. Hats off to Josh the manager and Stephanie our hostess. Maybe they can upgrade bath amenities and their general decor. Orange based decor is out folks! New rugs and suite rooms would be a nice change.However, every staff person was helpful and our room was quiet and lovely. They do listen to ones requests!Ask the front desk for the lust of local restaurants, it is helpful.Breakfast is excellent. A real plus.We will be back next year.I would like to sincerely thank you for your loyalty to our hotel. Your feedback is appreciated and necessary for our hotel to improve. I will be sure your comments get in the right hands. Josh and Stephanie were delighted to hear your feedback. We cannot wait to have you back soon!
1443	5	My husband and I stayed here on our way to Missouri. It's in a lovely area of downtown Little Rock with what I think is a dog park across the street. There are several restaurants within walking distance. Parking options include a parking garage that has restricted access from the street (so your vehicle is more protected than with most... More
1444	4	The location of this hotel was good for us as we wanted to be able to walk to the River Market area and to the Clinton Presidential Library (don't bother to see the library). The hotel was nice and the staff pleasant. Our room was clean. Parking is not too far but rather confusing.

More
1464	5	For the purpose of our stay this hotel was in a great location. It is close to the mall and many restaurants. The check in and breakfast staff were very professional and helpful. The breakfast has a charge, but is well worth it .
1465	3	The eggs were obviously powdered, biscuits were frozen, sausage lacked flavor, other items ok, small cups for juice and milk, had to refill at least 3 times just to satisfy my 3 year old granddaughter. Waffles, cereal, muffins good. Coffee was ok.
1466	5	We stayed here for a wedding. The staff was wonderful! Room and bathroom were small but very nice. Attached restaurant was very nice and food was delicious. Bread and Cocoa next door had great breakfast options.Dear Tiffany H, Your kind words and rave review are most appreciated. We are elated to hear your experience was great! Come visit us again very soon! Best wishes, Jeffrey Rosenkrantz Assistant Front Office Manager jrosenkrantzjdvhotels.com
1467	5	I have stayed at the Galleria a few times and have always been very impressed. It has a very cool vibe and and a lot of character. If I could, I would stay there every time I come to The City! My wife was with me for this trip and she said to me, I love this hotel!Dear P9458MDjonl, I am so glad to hear you enjoyed your stay with us! Character is something we most certainly are not short on. Thank you for staying with us and hopefully we get welcome you and your wife back next time you're in The City!All the Best, Charlie StockerDirector of Front Office
1468	4	The hotel was nice and in a great location. My room was inward looking so there was no view of anything and the window was very small so not much light, which wasn't a huge problem as I was out all day. The bathroom was compact but good, the bed comfortable and it was very clean which is important. There was no kettle though only a coffee maker which I was not able to make tea in. I definitely recommend you join in happy hour in the lobby to sample free wines. It was a very enjoyable experience. The staff were lovely and professional as well.Dear shaggygirlr0x,Thank you for taking the time to share your valuable feedback. We are happy to hear you enjoyed our unbeatable location while the team delivered a stellar experience. We look forward to your next visit, and another chance to enjoy all of our amazing amenities.Warmest regards,Jeffrey RosenkrantzAssistant Front Office Managerjrosenkrantzjdvhotels.com
1469	5	Great hotel in the perfect location for down town and Union Square. Rooms are pleasant and decorated in an eclectic style. Staff were very helpful and polite. Would recommend this hotel for a great short stay in San Francisco if want to avoid the anonymous big chain hotels
1470	5	Ideal location for CBD with a really helpful attitude from the whole staff team. Free WiFi, wine happy hour and water but the price merits these extras. No breakfast on site but plenty to offer in surrounding vibrant streets of fantastic San Francisco. My room well equipped but perhaps a little noisy from the street. Convenient for the centre however means I will be back. Quality and service in a great location merits the premium price.
1471	4	Stayed for two nights, an all-round good experience. Front desk exceptional. Valet parking only, at 38 dollars. Free wine at 5:30 every night. Although other reviewers have commented about noise we dont agree, no problems (August mid week). Rooms are well decorated and equipped bu small by US standards. Recommended.
1472	5	I stay here for very work regularly and it's a great SF hotel. It's very nice for the price, but not too fancy. The staff are exceptional - friendly, helpful and always quick to accommodate any requests. The rooms are appointed well some reviewers have mentioned that the rooms are on the small side but for the price in the city I don't miss a few extra square feet and doubt you would unless you're never leaving the room. It's a great location for work or fun.Dear Ttt709,Thank you for submitting a review of your recent stay at Galleria Park! We value our guest feedback as a gift.We are truly greatful for the kind words regarding the team here at GPH. Everyone from housekeeping to the front desk takes any steps necessary to meet and exceed guest expectations. We're thrilled that the stay went well and you found our location to be well suited for both business and play.We hope that if your travels bring you back to SF, you will consider another stay at Galleria Park Hotel.Sincerely,Jordan Whitney
1473	5	I've stayed in Joie de Vivre hotels more than a dozen times, and I'm alway please and highly satisfied. This stay was triggered by an email promotion for a Valentine's Day package that included parking and dinner at a marvelous French cafe. Beside the exception deal for the package, upon check-in, we were told, We're pleased to let you know that we have upgraded you to our Grande Suite, the largest room in our hotel!Staff was great. Room was pleasant. Wine tasting (free) was enjoyable and bustling.I'll most certainly be returning.Dear MMCimilla,Thank you for sharing your positive experience at the Galleria Park on Tripadvisor. I am very pleased to hear that you have made our hotel your true home away from home.I'm glad you enjoyed the courtesy upgrade to our Grand Suite as a small token of appreciation for being one of our loyal guest and for selecting our hotel to celebrate Valentine's.We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely,James Limjlimjdvhotels.com415-835-6473
1474	5	We were in San Francisco for our daughters wedding. We had a bunch if rooms booked for our family and friends. From the bellhop/valet to the front desk staff to everyone we met at the hotel, one could not find friendlier or more helpful people. This is a boutique hotel, and the location is perfect. The rooms are comfortable, and they have free wifi. There is a coffee setup on the mezzanine level in the mornings, and complimentary wine served in the lobby in the evening. There is valet parking, but like most places in San Francisco, it is expensive (38 plus taxes). We had a problem with our in room safe (we overstuffed it and jammed it so that it would not open). It was resolved almost immediately. About the only negative is that the restaurant is undergoing ownership changes/renovation, and is closed. We were hoping to have breakfast with our family and this change caught us by surprise (we had booked the rooms a year ago). Matt and Michelle (sales managers) could not have been more accommodating. They arranged for us to be able to have breakfast at the Bread Cocoa (just outside), and to have them run a tab for our guests. They were also nice enough to upgrade the bride (our daughter) to the nicest suite in the hotel, and to have a bottle of champagne for the couple to make it up to us. We loved our stay, as did our family and friends. We know where we will be staying when we next visit San Francisco.
1475	3	Me and three friends of mine stayed here for three nights, while visiting San Francisco for sightseeing. We booked the hotel thru priceline and got a rate for 160 US, which is ok for this hotel. The hotel itself is located some minutes food walk from Union Square, so the location is ok. The rooms are nice and have a good size, but are not very big. Bathroom is ok but not perfect. The lobby is nice and so is the interior. They service free wine in the late afternoon, which is nice. I had a room to the patio which is not too nice, because it is kind of dark. I looked the other rooms of my friends and they were much nicer because they were much lighter. Check in and check out was fine, room service was fine too. Before we booked the hotel, we looked up some other offers for other hotels in the internet. I dont know why, but prices were very high for that weekend in San Francisco, for that reason we thought the value for this hotel was ok. And the hotel itself was ok too. But I am not sure if I would come back to this hotel next time. Dont get me wrong, the hotel is not bad or anything, but there is just something which I didnt like even if I cant tell you what. I was not really sure if I should give 3 or 4 points to this hotel, so lets say I give 3.5 points.Overall, if you come here you dont do anything wrong, but dont expect too much. I think for a boutique hotel something is missing.
1476	5	I just stayed at the Galleria Park Hotel for the 2nd time this past weekend. The 1st time I stayed in this hotel was last year and I was immediately impressed upon entering the facilities. The decor in the lobby is very inviting and clean which provides for a very welcoming environment. As soon as you enter the staff on hand immediately greet you and ask what they can assist you with. All of the staff that I have come in contact with are very professional and eager to help. The actual rooms in the hotel are also consistent with the lobby...very clean and decorated with modern yet classic pieces. Not to mention the hotel is walking distance from EVERYTHING may it be the BART, Chinatown, Little Italy, Fisherman's Wharf etc. The surrounding area of the hotel is very safe and clean as well. Anytime I go to SF I plan to stay at this hotel. Also during my trip this past weekend a group of friends joined me and they stayed in the hotel as well. They also gushed about how conveniently located and cool the ambiance was. You can't go wrong staying here!Thank you for coming back to Galleria Park Hotel and making our hotel as your home away from home. I shared your kind comments with my staff. I am extremely proud of our team in the front office as they are indeed one of the friendliest and most professionals in the hospitality industry. Last year, the California Hotel Lodging Association awarded the Galleria Park the Best Service Award and it's because of our employees who care about our guests' stay.I hope to meet you personally when you return to San Francisco!Best,James
1477	5	My wife and I stayed here recently on our road trip around California. The hotel is centrally located for all the attractions and very close to Union Square. The hotels main areas and rooms themselves have a very bright and modern feel. The rooms themselves are compact but have all the usual facilities you would expect. The hotel does room service but there are no resturant or bar facilities on site although they do have some kind of connection to the bar/resturant next door. There is free wi-fi available throughout the hotel and an external running area on one of the lower floors. There is free tea and coffee available in the mornings and a free wine tasting session each evening.The staff were very helpful and were kean to help with our sightseeing plans. The staff also arranged an airport pick up service for us at the end of our stay.Overall a very calm and relaxing vibe and we would definitely stay here again.
1478	5	Galleria is a pretty boutique hotel with every detail that fits perfect for a well seasoned traveller. The amenities they offer end up saving you a lot of money. From the high quality coffee served every morning to the wine reception every night. The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful to get you around San Francisco and experience what this great city have to offer. I wholeheartedly would stay here without hesitation. In fact, this would be my first pick.
1479	4	We stayed at the Galleria Park for two days. Check in was great especially the doormen who were really busy but managed to get our many bags up the room quickly.The room was cozy which meant that two open suitcases made things crowded.The TV remote did not work which is usually not a disaster but it was the Olympics. The safe also needed batteries. In the normal course this is not a big deal either but I was carrying over 50 pounds of camera gear for shooting birds up the coast. So I checked it at the desk to avoid lugging it to dinner.When we came back from dinner later that evening there was my very expensive bag sitting on the floor with the claim check attached in front of the lobby fireplace. The travel gods were with me but it probably sat there for hours and no one stole it. The wine reception each day is done with panache and I must say that all the staff are pleasant and helpful.The Galleria is in a good location for shopping, some galleries and restaurants. I recommend it but keep your wits about you.
1480	5	I am a regular at the Galleria Park Hotel, where they treat me like family. It is a hotel with wonderful personality - funky, classy and comfortable. The place has character, but in an understated way. They don't try too hard or go over the top. The location is good for both business and fun. It's in the heart of the Financial district and very close to Union Square. The staff is warm, thoughtful and obviously empowered to make every guest happy. A true gem in a fabulous city!Dear Ms. Sondra K.: you are part of the Galleria family as you've been staying with us for many years. I'm glad that you found a permanent home away from home here in San Francisco. -James Lim
1481	5	Friendly helpful staff made visit very pleasant. Alma at the front desk is a gem. Pete and the valet guys are great! I would definitely go again. Close to metro and nice shopping area. They greet you by name each time they see you. (Not really sure how they do that!)
1482	5	This hotel was perfectly located near Union Square, yet just set back enough to enable a quiet night's sleep every night. The lobby is spectacular, the room was really comfortable and clean, and staff were possibly the nicest I've encountered. You get free in-room wi-fi (or free 20mins if you use hotel computers) and free use of a nice roof terrace. Also, it's close to Market Street, meaning you can easily get the trolley bus (2) to Fisherman's Wharf, as well as the more scenic (and more expensive) cable cars. Lots of shops nearby, including a 7-11 and Walgreen's.
1483	5	What a great location! The service was outstanding - from the front desk to the doorman to the valet. Thank you Richard, and every other staff member working during our stay for making our trip to San Francisco perfect.
1484	4	This was our second visit to the Galleria Park Hotel and we were not disappointed. The Executive King rooms are large, especially for San Francisco hotels, and comfortable. The disadvantage is that they face Kearny Street, and there is traffic noise all day and night (the hotel staff will give you earplugs!). The front desk staff and the valets/bell men are helpful and friendly. The wine hour is a wonderful late afternoon offering. There are many good restaurants and tourist sites within walking distance. There are two negatives: the housekeeping is inconsistent, some days much more thorough than others, and the parking is very expensive (not unexpected in San Francisco).Nevertheless, we will certainly return a third time!
1485	5	Fantastic location near Union Square with easy access and travel options. Room decor is very tasteful and housekeeping are doing a wonderful job. Lovely complimentary toiletries etc. Valet parking is fantastic and the staff couldn't be more helpful with directions and advice. Thoroughly recommend this hotel and hope to return.Dear Annette P, What a spectacular review!Thank you for your kind comments about our housekeeping team, they are the unsung heroes of our property. I truly think that what makes our proerty special is the people that work here and am thrilled we were able to provide you with a comfortable stay. Thank you again for taking the time to share your thoughts and we'll see you soon! Sincerely, Charlie Stocker
1486	5	San Fran was the first stop of our trip and everyone here made us feel very welcome. Its a small but great hotel. Room was a little snore and lacked storage for clothes but other than that everything was perfect. Location is on the money as well! Thanks for a great stay.
1487	5	I stayed here with the rest of my family during the Fourth of July weekend. The staff was very helpful and was very quick in helping us. Smooth sailing the whole two nights there. The free Keurig coffee and Tazo tea are easy pluses, and the homey feeling is just too good to resist. While my family and I were there, there was no room service because they were working on a restaurant. Too bad I won't be there when it's finished, but I can't say I'm not excited for it! All in all, for anyone who wants to be in a place that feels like home but is still close to the center of San Francisco, the Galleria Park Hotel is the place to go.
1488	4	This hotel is ideally suited for both shopping (Union Square) and access to the business district (about a 15 minute walk). There are fabulous restaurants also in the area. I would highly recommend particularly if you are a fitness enthusiast. There is a small gym (my only issue would be that there were queues every morning for the one treadmill) but there is also an outdoor running area which is nice to get some of the SF sun. There are a few free weights as well.Dear Marie S,Thank you for taking the time to review our property!I'm very happy you were able to enjoy all the fine things that make this location ideal from the dining, shopping, and the proximity to the Financial District. I am sorry that you encountered lines for the treadmill in the morning, due to the location of our hotel we have a number of business travelers who like to work out in the morning. Luckily we do have the walking track available to our guests and we also have wonderful jogging maps available that give you a few flat routes.We look forward to welcoming you back the next time you are in the city!Best Wishes,Jordan
1489	5	I had a great experience with everyone I came in contact with. While booking my room, Ben was awesome! He answered all the questions I was going to ask before I could ask them! We took BART into the city it was a short walk from the Montgomery station. Upon arriving the lobby was a little busy, but we were greeted immediately. They had a wine reception going on in the lobby that was very well attended. Andrew was great-he had a great smile was very friendly! Jill was awesome we had our room in just a few minutes. The room was great! The property is over 100 yrs old. I liked that they kept the older charm but modernized the rooms. The bathroom is great-large shower! The staff gave us a great recommendation for dinner. Stephen was great when we had an issue w/our key.The location is great. Just a few blocks to Union Square. Quiet in the evening due to being in the financial district. Great customer service by everyone! I will definitely be back!Dear K S,Thank you very much for the five star review of Galleria Park! We love to receive feedback from our guests.The entire GPH team is thrilled to learn your stay went well! We appreciate the shoutout to Ben, Stephen, Jill and Andrew as we feel the staff is what makes this hotel truly shine. On a personal note, I must say that I agree about the historic hotel with the modern feel... It is truly my favorite aspect of the entire property! We hope to see you when you return to San Francisco.Best,Jordan Whitney
1490	4	We stayed here recently for 3 nights. As we were travelling with our teenage son we needed a twin bedded room, this was on the 7th floor and whilst it was quite compact the beds were comfortable and there were free tea coffee making facilities.Also if you didn't have housekeeping and hung the relevant hanger on your door you were given 2 bottles of water the next day. We did this one day and we're going to it the next but decided to have our sheets and towels changed. I asked at reception if they could do this and by the time we returned from our sightseeing it had been carried out.There are no breakfast facilities at the hotel but tea and coffee are served in the mezzanine in the morning. You can get a good breakfast right next door as well. There's also a happy hour every night in the lobby where there is free wine and you can chat to other guests.All in all this hotel is modern in a lovely old building, great helpful staff and valet parking. Fantastic location for union square, easy walking distance to China town and to the port. There's a bus stop on the adjacent street as well.Great stay and would definitely recommend as a good location for checking out all of San Francisco's sights.
1491	2	Room 711- This was a two night stay for a training session and upon checking in I discovered the desk chair was all ripped up (plether- plastic leather) missing from 1/3 of the seat, living room chair was used as a cat scratching post, stained dirty drapes, carpet-not vacuumed, no hot water in the tiny stand-up curtained shower-four mins into the shower-lather on hair and soap all over- (got points for my unfortunate experience). One of the bedroom doors (2 BR suite) had nail heads sticking out (discovered them when placing my hand there). Knowing that it was spring break week, I would think the staff was ready for the crowd- room was not serviced on day 2 of the stay until much later in the afternoon. Going back to Hilton.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your guest experience. I was disappointed to hear that the experience was not to your satisfaction or our standards. I sincerely apologize that the issue was not corrected prior to your departure. I appreciate you bringing this to our attention so that we can improve the service we provide our guests.Sincerely,Traci
1492	2	Hotel literally on route 35..translation. .hwy noise all night.Hotel location central to a lot of things.Hotel not maintained. Not clean. No reinvestment in hotel updates.

1493	4	While this particular Residence Inn has been here a while they have updated the site and it is very nice. Clean - well maintained - comfortable rooms - suprisingly quiet considering it is close to several main highways - easy access - nice lite dinners each eveningDear Guest,I appreciate you taking the time to share your experience. I am pleased that the accommodations were a nice suprise. Thank you for choosing Residence Inn. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and we hope to welcome you back in the future!Best regards,Traci
1494	4	This was more than we expected for the weekend! Comfortable bed, clean and quiet room with friendly, attentive staff. Yes, it's not perfect...could be closer to places for eats and drinks, the TV in the master bedroom was ancient and small but we weren't in Dallas to watch television! Perfect location in proximity to Fair Park..will definitely stay again.
1495	5	Some Nature around the area as we seen deer in the field next door. We had a 2 Queen Bed and had lots of room to move around and being tall I need that. Over-all it was a nice stay and service was good.Thank you for your postings on Trip Advisor. We do have deer that like to visit us, they come down to get some good grass to eat. We hope that you will come and visit us in the future.

We love everything about Silver Baron from the private hot tubs, to the awesome pools, to the... More
1510	5	The Staff were friendly and helpful. The day was hot but our room was cool and refreshing. We would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family and we will choose to stay there should we find ourselves in Salt Lake again.
1511	3	OK hotel at OK price not too far from Bricktown, Cox Center, etc. Hotel under renovation so not in top shape. Room was small but clean. Firm king bed. Construction/renovation noise during the day. Highway noise slightly audible in our room at night, although not too bad. Front desk understaffed when we arrived (around 8pm, only one person on duty... More
1512	5	We loved our stay at this BB. The location was just far enough away from the crowds, the food scrumptious, the surroundings peaceful and beautiful. The hosts were most accommodating and had some very helpful ideas for our visit.
1513	5	Although I have written previously about this wonderful place, I have to report again after having gone back a third time. Since the last visit, Owners Denise/Keith have added a beautiful gazebo to the southwestern back yard. There are three sitting areas on the back patio and three more in the yard . Your privacy is observed as you sit... More
1514	5	Perfect place to stay when visiting our Mom. We had the room with the private patio and it was really comfortable, clean and lovely. The breakfast was gourmet with a local/Mexican twist - lovely presentation and fun variety. Zorro, the Standard Poodle, was well behaved and friendly. Rico, the parrot, was shy on our visit. Stayed two nights. Definitely will... More
1515	5	We loved our stay at this BB. The location was just far enough away from the crowds, the food scrumptious, the surroundings peaceful and beautiful. The hosts were most accommodating and had some very helpful ideas for our visit.
1516	5	Our 4th (or 5th ) visit 12/7 12/8/15 was like coming home. Denise gave some excellent tips on new things to see do, places to shop. Keith does wonderful breakfasts. Zorro is the sweetest dog, so well behaved. Rico is a beautiful Macaw. Everywhere you look is something beautiful and interesting....so many special touches that make the... More
1517	3	This is an average hotel, next to a nice Peggy Sue's restaurant. The hotel is convenient to Zion N.P. about an hour away. The wireless in the back building was not working except in our bathroom, They have a nice pool and hot tub.
1518	1	MoreMore
1519	3	The location is good and it is a good option if you have pets. The bed was clean and comfortable. I was disappointed in the quality of the towels, they were cheap and scratchy. Also, the breakfast was extremely disappointing. Not very many options and the hot breakfast was eggs and fried bologna, not very appetizing. Overall it was good... More
1520	5	I love staying at the Hampton franchises. I always receive great service. From the night auditor to the breakfast person, everyone is pleasant. We always stay at Hampton Inns when we travel. Thanks again everyone.
1521	5	We were using a gift card chose to spend an overnight near home to just relax dine out. At this time of year the price was so reasonable. The room we had was a suite and included a sofa, 2 queens, 2 large TVs, a microwave fridge. The bathroom area had 2 separate areas both with sinks.... More
1522	5	I take my kids (now ages 6 and 9) to the Dells several times a year. I received an email from the hotel with some excellent rates so we went fairly last minute the weekend before Christmas. The hotel is very clean and well kept. All the employees were friendly and accommodating. Free breakfast in the morning was well organized... More
1523	5	Stayed here on my way up the peninsula, have stayed before, still meets my expectations and does not disappoint. Staff was friendly and the GM even came out and talked with me too. Did not have top floor room like I typically choose but it still was a nice room with jetted tub. Views are a bit underwhelming due to... More
1524	4	Made a quick trip to the Ocean Shores, WA area to take my Mom and Dad to the ocean. The entire family had a great stay. Awesome rooms, nice views, great prices. I loved having the jacuzzi in my room. Both my wife and I really enjoy a good soak. I have stayed at several of the other hotels in... More
1525	5	This hotel is in a very convenient location. Only 15 minutes to Tulip Town and Roozengaarde. Everything in the Skagit Valley was easy to get to yet still not a lot of congestion in the hotel area. The included breakfast was pretty good but not great. Best of all, in my opinion, was that our room was very, very clean.... More
1526	5	Good quality accommodations for reasonable price. The hotel is somewhat dated, however has large rooms, wide hallways, and rooms are clean. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Breakfast is a step-above with made to order omelets in addition to the usual breakfast items. Away from the main highways, however close to shopping and restaurants. Good location for tulip festival as well... More
1527	3	Pros: Very friendly and helpful staff. Cons: Property needs major updates. The rooms were large, but dark and very outdated. (I have never encountered a worse coffee maker in a hotel room - whatever this contraption brewed, I wouldn't call it coffee). We also noticed that exterior doors to the hotel were not locked. Overall, this was fine for one... More
1528	3	We stayed at this hotel April 9-11 when we were in town for the Tulip Festival. We chose this hotel because it was the top rated for Mount Vernon on tripadvisor, and traveling a long distance (from the Spokane area), I wanted to be assured that we would be comfortable and have a good night's sleep. Although the room was... More
1529	4	I had the chance to spend a week at this hotel. Very clean and quiet rooms.I recommend it. Very close to Dallas attractions and restaurants.Just one reminder: you can't take the breakfast to your room, which it's not a problem because the restaurant is nice and comfortable.Greetings Joel D, From all of the staff and management at the Best Western Plus Dallas Hotel and Conference Center, we appreciate your business and thank you for staying at our property. We are also glad to hear that you enjoyed our property location and our full hot breakfast buffet. Thank you again for the lovely review and please do not hesitate to reach out to me as I will personally make your next reservation for you. Best Regards,Eric G. - Director of Sales and MarketingEricBWDallas.com
1530	5	For the price and what you receive this is a great deal. I spent one night. Breakfast was awesome and staff was welcoming. The room was large and free wifi! I would definitely stay here again. Call or go to their website.Dear Julia A., We are so glad you so enjoyed your stay at the newly renovated full service Best Western Plus Dallas Hotel Conference Center! Pleased that you got to take advantage of some of the complimentary amenities such as full hotel breakfast and WIFI. Also so glad you encountered welcoming staff. Thank you for your stay and your positive review. Safe travels!
1531	4	Here we are in Dallas! Think South Fork Ranch, Billy BOb's place all the Texas stuff you can recall from TV movies. Larger than Life, Dallas is Something. As a small town girl, I was SO Glad we were on a tour our driver was top notch! In Michigan we have two seasons, winter construction. Well In Texas they have one... Construction with weather breaks. But the Best Western PLUS Dallas Hotel lived up to its name. We were whisked up to our clean quiet room. Our King bed was well made, comfortable with Good pillows (sometimes we find the puffy rocks that give you a crick in the neck - not here) The room was clean all the amenities were there. We offloaded ourselves, tidied up in our room headed out to see Dallas Fort Worth to go to Billy Bob's. But more about that later.We found the two nights we stayed with the BW crew to be comfortable, positive experiences. We found the two breakfasts we ate there to be outstanding. If it wasn't on the Breakfast bar, you didn't need it. The breakfast room was kept clean the buffet well stocked. They worked! There were two other tour groups there when we were. We all descended on the food like locusts. But the staff was up to it. a dish began to look near empty zoom it was refilled with fresh hot replacements. The people who work in housekeeping deserve a shout out! They do a job to be proud of. Being on LBJ Freeway, it was pretty much easy on off... if you are a nascar driver. but then I already told you I'm a traffic coward, didn't IThank you so much for your very kind comments!!!I am glad you have a wonderful experience both here at the Best Western Plus and in Dallas. Come back and visit us next time you are in the area!Warm Wishes,John Bright HarrisAssistant General ManagerBest Western Plus Dallas Hotel Conference Center
1532	3	Hotel in the average, nothing special but clean and very well located (10 min taxi to downtown/uptown). Is an essential hotel, located in a good position with a reasonable rate. Rooms dimensions are good, internet quite fast and with a good coverage in the building. Restaurant in the complex, parking free
1533	4	I've stayed here twice in the past year. Once with a group and then recently, alone. It is clean and in a good area, with a non-Best Western restaurant on the property. The pool is small and in the parking lot, so I wouldn't go to this location for fun in the sun. But if you need a place that is easily accessible and clean and a good value, then I recommend this hotel.
1534	5	We travel across country a couple times per year. We always stay here. The people are helpful AND they are pet friendly and very friendly and accommodating. It is an easy off and on from I40. We will definitely be staying here again.
1535	4	We stayed one night to while a family member was in the hospital. When I reserved it said they are renovating, but we did not notice any noise or construction dust. It was a great experience. Our room was clean. All the staff we talked to were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again.
1536	1	This motel should be condemned it is the nastiest motel i have ever had the dissatisfaction of staying in. I was given room 11 it smelled like pee and stagnant beer and it was filthy with pubic hair in the sink and floor there was cockroach and hatched egg sacks on the edges of the walls. I tried to use... More
1537	5	Place was awesome clean , comfortable. Had problem with one guest but took care of the issue on my own !
1538	4	We had car trouble while on our way home from vacation. The owners were extremely helpful, went above and beyond to help us. Most any other hotel would not want to bother. Thank you! The room was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay again.
1539	5	We reserved a room for our annual ski vacation and yes, everything was just perfect. Very nice, clean and spacious room with all the needed amenities. Plenty of choices for really good restaurants around the hotel. Staff are very courteous, very attentive, knowledgeable, pleasantly approachable...More
1540	3	Designers decided to go with a dull brown decor and very low lighting making much of the hotel dreary and a bit depressing. Fortunately we had a corner room with two windows but it still felt dark. The hallways were so badly lit. Bathroom was...More
1541	5	The Bryant Park Hotel is perfectly located in the mid-town area. Walking distance to the theater district and good shopping. The hotel staff are wonderful - friendly, yet very professional. I was pleasantly surprise of the size of the room and bathroom. Would definitely stay...MoreThank you for giving us 5 stars and for all your wonderful praises. I am so happy to hear you had such a great stay and enjoyed the staff, location and guest room. The best compliment is to welcome guests back and we can't wait...More
1542	5	We stayed just one night during winter break. It is a large hotel but well laid out. The rooms are very large, nicely decorated, and very comfortable. The pool area is beautiful with a very large swimming pool surrounded by palm trees and vegetation. Very enjoyable location. It is on the est side of Key West, a few miles from where all the action is. The the island is so small that you can ride your bicycle to Duval.Dear foundufafa,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Nice Stay and enjoyed your Room as well as our Pool Area. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Nice stay.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager
1543	5	Clean larger sized rooms, newly built /renovated. Was on 2nd floor back side of property rooms, very quiet. Nice pool. Enjoyed complimentary self serve breakfast. Coffee was excellent. It was a good choice and wonderful place to stay.Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback. We appreciate your compliments, and are thrilled that we exceeded your expectations. We look forward to your return.
1544	4	I love the place. We reached late night around 1, front desk staff was on the spot. Room was clean and good. Breakfast and pool area is well decorated and have modern look. Breakfast was also very good.Dear AnupkGupta,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Nice Stay and enjoyed our Breakfast and Pool as well. It is also good to here my overnight staff was on the Spot. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Nice stay.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager
1545	4	From the ouside the Fairfield Inn looks a bit dull but from the inside it looks very good. The room I had was directly infront of the pool. The room itself looked really nice and clean. The bathroom was also nice and clean. The reception staff and concierge were very nice and friendly to us.The breakfast had a wide variety and it looked good.Dear Thomas T,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We are Happy that you had a great stay and was bale to enjoy our Breakfast and that our staff was helpful and friendly, that is always Great to hear. We hope to see you back again with us very soon.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager
1546	5	Brand new property, with a beautiful pool. Everything was extremely clean, the staff was very friendly and there to help with any questions we had. Would highly recommend and we would definitely stay here again.Thank you for your Fantastic comment. We are all here to help you enjoy your visit to Paradise. Thanks for staying with us. Hope to see you again soon.
1547	4	We stayed at this Fairfield inn in Feb. 2016 with a 2.5 year old. It was perfect for a family. We had a room overlooking the pool which I loved. The pool gets a lot of sun in the morning which is nice for sipping coffee by or if it is warm enough a dip. The pool was heated where we didn't mind swimming in it even when the temp didn't get above 70. Breakfast was better than I expected. The eggs were actually scrambled not like the weird omelet I had before at a budget motel. We always had enough at breakfast to carry us through at least the next cuban sandwich shop. I used the gym there which was ok a few cardio machines including an elliptical and free weights and exercise balls. The nice thing was I was the only one in there both times I used it. The hotel isn't walking distance to much but we were able to find parking every time we went downtown. I think it was quieter because we weren't around any partying.
1548	5	Stayed here Sunday July 16th and what a nice place ! Angel, the Front Office Manager was very warm and welcoming at check in. Our room was very clean from the headboards, to the PTAC filters to the bathroom.....very very good housekeeping department at this property ! Breakfast was very good and the front desk lady at check out asked how our stay was and was very cordial. Lobby and common areas are clean and well maintained. Great jobTo the General Manager and his talented staff ! Dear LintonManager,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Great Stay and enjoyed our Breakfast and is always Great to see Comments regarding our Staff.. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Great stay.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager
1549	3	This was probably one of my least favorite hotel stays ever. The rooms were cleanish, though there was pink mold all over the shower in the bathroom. Had to ask to get the room cleaned. The pool is literally on Roosevelt Boulevard, so you cannot escape the sound of traffic driving by. Not relaxing at all. Worst though was the front desk: every time I went there there would be two people behind the desk and yet only one working, answering phones and dealing with guests at the same time. Took forever to check in, get pool towels, get an extra key... Probably would not stay here again unless desperate.Dear tdeluzuraga,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. I want to apologize for not being up to the standards that a Marriott should be. I thank you for the all the comments you provide and will be sharing to the rest of my Team so that we can give attention to these details. We take all reviews very seriously so that we may better serve our guests. Please let me know if I can do anything for you in the future.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager
1550	5	Room was great and quiet especially since it was spring break!!! Taxi service is excellent! Try all the bars great food and drinks pool is great! Prices are very competitive Key west is a great vacation to have laughs and snorkel and enjoy the beautiful waters and the greenery. Also the cemetery is so interesting..
1551	3	Rooms were very clean and nicely furnished, window A/C kind of noisy. Breakfast is included, water with coffee in it, and the scrambled were pretty flat. They should just give it a little more, that's all. Pool and hot tub open 24 hours I believe.Dear KenSanFrancisco,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. it is always good to get feedback from our guest, so that we can make things better for all over our guests. I am glad that you enjoyed the room and hope that we see you back in Key West soon.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager
1552	4	We were upgraded and the roomWas nice. It was on the highway but the noise was minimal. Breakfast was very good! They provide a paying shuttle (21 a day PP) to Mallory Square. It stops at three other hotels first. One time it was already full when it arrived so we had to wait for a second shuttle. Coming back the shuttle was packed. Even though there are signs that clearly state no standing, they packed us in like sardines. The driver Tommy D even allowed passengers to sit on the steps! This was too dangerous and should not be permitted! I would NOT recommend the shuttle, the Old Time Trolley has a pickup two blocks away, I would use this as it is cheaper and they charge 10 PP for the second day. Cheaper!!! Only problem is the last stop is at 5 PM. I am told Taxi's are fairly cheap! They need to get Uber on the island!I would return!Thank you for sharing your experience. We appreciate your business and value your honest feedback. Your comments have been shared with the hotel team as a critical way of understanding how we can deliver exceptional service to guests like you. Thank you for staying at The Keys Collection and we hope you choose to create more memories with us whenever your travels bring you back to Key West.
1553	5	This was my first time here, surely won't be the last. I had the pleasure to meet a very welcoming group of people. I was very satisfied with my service, especially from Ines, the amazing bartender! She was very friendly and carried an excellent conversation! I hope to be back here sooner, rather than later! Lol!Thank you for taking the Time to Review our Hotel. I am always happy to hear about our staff and the Service that they Provide to our Guests. I am glad that you had an Excellent stay with us. And we too, hope you will be back sooner then later.Thank you again,Eric B - Hotel Manager
1554	3	We stayed here several nights in late April. Key West hotels are very expensive and this is a good value for the area. That said, it is still expensive and the rooms average. Our room was clean, quiet, good size, with a microwave and refrigerator. We were in the third building on the parking lot side and did not have street noise. There is a guest laundry, nice pool area, plenty of free parking, a good complimentary breakfast. The staff was friendly and very helpful. As others have mentioned, the hotel is a couple miles from town and too far to walk in the heat. We drove into town and parked at the garage. Thank you very much for taking the time to review our property. We take all reviews seriously so that we can better serve our guests. We agree that we are a little far for the night life and the other action of the island. With that as of May 1st we have added a shuttle service to get our Guests to and from the Old Town Area. There is a small charge per day, but it at a better rate then a taxi service our Parking. I hope that you had a relaxing time while you were here in Key West and hope that you come back soon.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager
1555	5	Everything from the check-in front staff to the room was great. No major complaints. The only complaint I have is the continental breakfast is lacking a selection. I know it is a free continental breakfast but I have stayed at other hotels that had a very nice selection of food and were cheaper and then the second morning they had run out of orange juice by 8:00am. Even with these little thigs I still would stay there again.Thank you for your comments and feedback. I am sorry to hear we ran out of OJ. I will look into our ordering system to make sure this does not happen again. Thanks for staying with us. Hope to see you back soon.
1556	5	We stayed at the Marriott Courtyard for two nights after our Alaska cruise on points. From the very beginning the entire stay was awesome! We arrived really early planning to park our luggage and walk around the lake until our room was ready. We were lucky enough to have Becky Schaefer check us in, what an amazing experience this was! She was so friendly and immediately wished us a happy anniversary. She thanked us for choosing their hotel and offered to keep our bags while we went to lunch, even suggested a few venues within walking distance. Then, all at once she said they did have a room ready if we didn't mind the 3rd floor!! This was 11:00!! We were thrilled and checked into our room. The room was well appointed and spacious (considering we just came off our cruise in a cabin half the size). It was warm and sunny so we changed into shorts and then a knock at the door....in came a bottle of wine, chips and chocolates along with a note from Becky Happy Anniversary! Then the phone rang and it was Becky checking our delivery....I know this sounds made up but Becky is an example of awesome customer service!!!! Can't rave about her enough. If you check in to this hotel tell Becky that Kent and Carol sent you. You'll be guaranteed a BIG smile!!Hi C B,Thank you so much for your wonderful review and experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. I can't wait to share your comments to our Team. We are delighted to know you had great celebration-stay at our hotel. We hope to see you again!Sincerely,Dan Pham, Guest Service Representative
1557	5	We chose this hotel to see the fireworks July 4, 2015. We picked the correct hotel, because the staff, particularly Patrick Manley went out of the way to be sure we could see as much of the fireworks as was humanly possible. All the front desk staff are on their game and go out of their way to help. Emilee Nowlin stood out with her enthusiasm and assistance to our many questions. We also feel the bistro staff did a fabulous job in spite of the holiday rush. There could be improvement in the menu. On our last day we met the GM, and now know that his training, mentoring and management by walking around makes a lot of difference in how a hotel is run. The best Courtyard we have stayed in so far. Hope to see you all again.Thank you so much for sharing your 4th of July experience at our hotel on Trip Advisor!We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that our associates were such a great part of what made your experience an excellent one!Have a wonderful rest of your summer and we hope to see you back again soon!Sincerely,Rachel PackardFront Office Supervisor
1558	5	We have stayed at this hotel several times. Always enjoyable. Staff is excellent, friendly and knowledgeable. The beds and pillows are supreme. We opted for a Lake View which allows visitors to watch Sea Planes take off and Rowing Teams Practice. We had dinner in the Bar/Restaurant which was also quite good with amazing staff. Easy access to the U of W and Pikes Market. Hi pattipumkin,Thank you so much for staying at our hotel again. We also very much appreciate your time in sharing your experience on your stay. We are so happy to know that you got to enjoy the lake view and watch the sea planes and row boats in action. We hope to see you again on your next visit to Seattle!Sincerely,Dan P
1559	5	Ask for a room with a lake view! Hotel has a nice view of Lake Union and you can watch sea planes take off and land. Hotel was clean - room was good sized - bed was comfortable - internet service good - limited TV channel selection. Lobby bar was a fun place on a football night - and staff was very attentive. Parking is available under the hotel and across the street.Thank you for sharing your experience at our hotel on Trip Advisor! We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us, especially the view from your room and our staff's attentive service. Courtyard is the official hotel sponsor of the NFL so we're always excited for a game night in our Bistro!We look forward to your next stay with us!
1560	5	Great location, easy into downtown and outlying areas. The room was very nice with a view of the lake and harbor. There was a restaurant on site and Starbuck's coffee kiosk in the morning as well as in-room coffee. There is also an indoor pool and hot tub and covered parking. Staff was very helpful.
1561	4	I am a Marriott Gold member and was expecting some of the benefits to be provided for during my recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle. Disappointingly not much, not even breakfast is included. The only benefit I think is the additional points added on to my Marriott account for my 4 day at the hotel. I could have given this a 3 star rating but the property does have very nice and clean rooms. There is a laundry room which is clearly well maintained, orderly and clean. For that, I am giving it a 4 star rating. Dear chm0h,Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. I'm am glad to hear you had a comfortable stay with us. Gold Elite members are eligible to many benefits however, breakfast is not one of the benefits at our hotel. I would like to speak with you to discuss more. Please reach out to me at 203-213-0100. Again, thank you for staying at our hotel.Sincerely,Dan P.
1562	4	My wife and I are active travelers who view a hotel as only a place to sleep and have breakfast so we can spend the time touring. We got the room with Marriott points, but would have otherwise spent the 269 for this prime location. It is away from the craziness of the Pike's place wharf but 10min from downtown on the trolley (1 per day for seniors) Seattle Rapid Transit is light years ahead of the rest of the U.S. --safe, clean, wheelchair access, and ON TIME!Although on points, hotel management quickly moved us to another room when we asked for a little less road noise. The in-house Starbucks Coffee was a plus. The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. The desk staff were extremely tourist friendly readily giving tips and directions. Three budget eateries are a block away, but the staff knows the better dining venues as well. Just walking along Lake Union is a treat with the float planes, marinas and swimmers.This hotel will be our retreat whenever we visit Seattle in the future.Dear Douglas D,Thank you for your comments. We are very fortunate to have so many great reviews here on TripAdvisor and I greatly appreciate you adding your experience. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed the location of our hotel and the nearby eateries and attractions. Its a plus to know that we were able to deliver a memorable hotel experience during your travel in Seattle, and I cannot wait to share your comments to our staff! We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative
1563	5	Stayed on this hotel for a business trip, but it allowed the trip to become a sight-seeing one. The room faced the Space Needle and EMP museum. The room was cozy, had all amenities (it was a house room with kitchenette, fridge, microwave). The place is very clean and modern, and the staff were very accommodating and understanding when there was a charge issue with my corporate card. The place has free shuttles to downtown Seattle, and is within walking distance from a lot of tourist attractions. I would stay on this hotel again, no problem.Dear Ugo C,Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I am glad to hear that you found our location to be great and our hotels staff to be helpful and accomodating! I greatly appreciate your 5 star review it will be celebrated with the hotel. If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. We very much appreciate your business! Sincerely,Jon
1564	3	I would not recommend this hotel, the staff were not helpful, we had issues with our bills and the front desk said they could not adjust. The power went out in the room and maintenance could not fix it, got ready in the dark with no power.
1565	3	I really enjoyed the room and vibe at the Hyatt House in Seattle. It was a great hotel to chill out and get work done. We were able to work all day during a rainstorm and the room was comfortable and large enough for 2 people to never cross paths while working.My only complaint is that they checked me out early before my guest was ready and they woke him up and interrupted him 9 times between the time I left and he checked out. Upon calling the hotel, the staff was very apologetic and gave him a nice bottle of wine to compensate for the miscommunication.
1566	1	The hotel is well located for tourist attractions and check-in was easy. Getting maid service of any kind was next to impossible. No one would take responsibility of any kind. I called corporate and they agreed and called the hotel. Finally a general manager spoke with me and guaranteed my room would be cleaned between 9 am and 2 pm the next day when I was to attend a wedding. It didn't happen. Bathroom trash really does need to be disposed of daily. Both elevators broke during our stay and we never saw a repair person. So 6 flights of stairs every time. What was to have been a joyous occasion turned in to a very bad experience.Dear TravelingJeffry,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us here at the Hyatt house Seattle. I am sorry that your stay did not go as planned and that your room was not serviced and the elevators were down for maintenance. I can see how this would be create a very bad experience or you while you were in town for a wedding. Also that I did not get to speak with you in person while you were staying with us. If you choose to stay with us again and I hope you do give us another opportunity then please reach out to me directly and I will ensure your stay is wonderful. Again I am sorry if we let you down this is the opposite of our purpose. Sincerely,Jonathan
1567	5	Staff were excellent and resolved a problem of my making at the check-in, in a very kind and efficient way. Reception staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. Big thanks to Rhona, Amy and another lady on Reception who's name I didn't get (sorry!) The room was superb, big, clean and with a fantastic view of the Space Needle and EMP Museum and park. The housekeeping staff obviously work hard in keeping the hotel in tip top order and it shows. Can't fault any aspect of this hotel and I know where I'll be staying if I return to Seattle.Dear John M. Thank you very much for the feedback and thank you for choosing the Hyatt house Seattle! I am very pleased that you enjoyed your stay and thought we were a Top Hotel! I will pass on to the front desk the kind words about them (I know they will appreciate it). We thank you for your business and we look forward to hosting you again!! Most Sincerely,Jon M.
1568	2	When we booked the hotel we requested that we have a view of the space needle When I called the day before we left to confirm our stay the woman I spoke too specifically said she was going to be the one to assign the rooms would make sure we had a view We arrived and while we checked in the front desk man seemed bothered by us. We asked where we pull up for the bell hop to help us with our bags (we were in town for a book signing, so we had boxes of books, table decorations,gifts etc.) Not to mention we were staying for a week so we had quite a few bags. We were told
1569	5	Dan at the desk was as usual very helpful, Gary the van driver was fun. They took us to the conference center and when done picked us up.The view from the room is SPACE NEEDLE. you pay a little more for the view but well worth it. Easy 2 blocks to the needle and Pacific Center.

1570	5	My first time at the Hyatt house and amazing little hotel within easy reach of SLU, from check-in to check-out the staff were fantastic across house keeping, breakfast and evening bar staff. On the day of check-out the protests were causing havoc with uber/Lyft and the hotels town car was busy so hotel quickly arranged for another service to come and pick me up so I did not miss my transatlantic flight. I'll definitely stay here again when next back in Seattle.

1571	1	We had booked this hotel for two nights after our cruise in January . Two months before we were to arrive our plane home was moved to an exceptionally early time. We decided we had to stay at an airport hotel in order to make our plane, since we had to be at the airport by 4:30AM. I called to cancel the one night. Imagine my surprise when Hyatt raised the room rate for the remaining night 165. I questioned the reasoning and was told that even though we had until 24 hours before to cancel they treated the remaining night as a new reservation. We found a different hotel a block away and cancelled this entire reservation. Beware!
1572	5	Me and my boyfriend stayed there 4 nights while we were in town for my brothers wedding. We stayed in a suite with a view of the space needle. We loved it Central location with plenty of attractions!Thank you for taking the time to post this! We are of course delighted to hear that you enjoyed your time with us. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and hope that it won't be the last time we have the privilege. Cheers!
1573	5	Awesome location, walking distance to great restaurants including Space Needle restaurant, spacious rooms with kitchen, hard working staff, shuttle to rail to take to the airport. When I come back to Seattle I will stay at Hyatt House again. Hyatt brand speaks for it self. D

1575	2	Housekeeping left my door unlocked, and at the end of my stay the staff charged the wrong credit card. The people were pleasant, but if I had a choice between brusque staff who did their jobs properly and pleasant people who did not, I'd take brusque.Paul M,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. I sincerely apologize about the inconveniences during your stay and will use your review to make the appropriate changes to improve our guest experience. Your feedback is essential to us and we hope to have the opportunity as our guest once again. Sarah Junge
1576	4	I really enjoyed my stay at the Hyatt House, the service is excellent and the rooms good. The rooms are spacious but more comparable to a studio apartment than a regular hotel room. The location even though it is next to the Space Needle is a tad bit inconvenient. There are very few decent restaurants in the area but having said that the hotel offers free transportation within a one mile radius of the hotel. Additionally there is a monorail that goes from the Space Needle to downtown.The free breakfast buffet is comparable to most other hotels of this kind but the area was definitely more clean and organized than the norm.Mark J,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. We pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.Sarah Junge
1577	1	Never had such bad experience before. Stayed in this hotel for 9 nights, there were so many incidents happened during my stay.First night, I requested double room when I check in, they gave me three times twin room.And I asked for a room with the view, they said I have to pay 6USD extra, which I agreed, then I found it was much more than what I have been told. Second night, I was being locked outside of my room. After changing the key card three times, they found out that it was the lock issue,they asked me to wait in the lobby till midnight, and then arranged me a room next door,which was not even cleaned thoroughly. Yuk, imagine that sleeping at a room with someone else left belongings.Third day, I was being notified that the lock of my room was fixed, so I can move back to my own room, such a relief, I was wondering what I am gonna do if I couldnt get back to my room, since all my stuffs are there. So I took a quick shower before going back to my room. Guess what I have found out when I change back to my own room The door was left unlocked and nobody was there!!! I had to quick check if anything was missing. Just when I decided to relax a bit in my room, someone came in my room without even knocking my door. He left immediately when he saw I was in the room without saying a word. I went to ask what that was for, he told me he just want to confirm if I need room service. I think that makes sense, and I answered yes, I need. but why didnt he knock first I went out for sightseeing during the day, when I get back to the room, it was exact the same as I left, nobody came to clean it. So I called them to ask why they didnt do the housekeeping since they came to my room specifically to ask if I require room service, which I answered yes, in the morning. They did send someone over to do it though after that phone call.Fourth day, since I thought they just did the cleaning the late night before, I left my room with DND sign on the door. Guess what happened My room was cleaned!!! Whats more, I was locked in the elevator for nearly ten minutes that night, and I had to call for help.Fifth day, I found my credit card has been charged by the hotel with a strange amount of money. So I called them to ask why. The person who answered the phone said they will investigate and get back to me. I was waiting and waiting, still no answer, until I get back to the hotel at the night, I had to explain myself again with what happened to another their staff. Yet, still no answer.Sixth day, they charged my credit card again, which makes me so furious, since they just did whatever they want without asking for my permission. Seventh day, after I called four times, finally, they found the reason why my credit card has been charged.Because they didnt preauthrize enough money when I checked in, so they have to do it again and again. I said why it is different amount of money then, they couldnt give me a straight answer. And when I asked why they didnt inform me first Yet, no straight answer.Eighth night, I have been charged again, but I could guess what it was for already.The check out day was the most smooth day during my entire stay. I asked them to print my bill. And I am so glad that I did.To be fair, the location of this hotel is really nice, since it is just next to the Space Needle. The breakfast is too blunt. Strong smell of the decoration for not only the lobby, also the room. But the attitude of their staff is really good. And they are actually quite helpful. So I wasnt going to write my experience until today when I saw the final invoice I was being charged around 60USD for parking fee. Ironically, I dont even have a driving license, and I have never drove a car!!! This is soooooooo ridicules. I have stayed in many hotels in variety locations around the world, never suffered as badly as in this hotel. Worst experience ever and super disappointed.Dear mgx2222,Thank you so much for choosing to stay at Hyatt Place during your recent trip to Seattle. I would like to first and foremost apologize on behalf of the hotel and entire staff for the unsatisfactory experience you encounter during your recent visit. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. I could make excuses about the newness of the hotel and the lack of experience of our staff, but that doesnt rectify your inconvenience. Its important for us to hear the feedback from our guests, as we want to improve and make the necessary changes that lead to positive experiences. We are addressing these concerns with the appropriate departments. We always want to be a part of great travel memories. Please let us know when you come back to Seattle as we would love to welcome you back!Sincerely, Sarah Junge
1578	3	Despite booking the room type that you think you are getting online, you may find out that the room looks nothing like what you see in the pictures and what is described. The hotel is newer, in a great location and parking is more affordable than most hotels. If the room type is something that you look for in booking a hotel, then my suggestion is go in with low expectations. Hello!Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. While we have a number of different room configurations, all of the photographs on our website are taken here at the hotel and are of the specific room types they advertise. It sounds like we made a mistake with your reservation, which is definitely not typical. I am so sorry that was your experience and hope to have a chance to serve you again in the future. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you are coming back to Seattle. We would be happy to take the time to double-check that your preferences are being honored, as is our standard operating procedure. Thank you again and safe travels to you, wherever you go!
1579	4	The location is fabulous .... we were on the second floor and monorail noise was a little loud - we had no view but I'm sure some would be amazing. We did enjoy the very filling breakfast each morning as well as the shuttle service to Pike Place, the Aquarium and Target.
1580	5	My teenage daughter had a dance across the EMP and this was literally across the street ! The view is amazing and the place was very chill and for a hotel chain, it felt like a local neighborhood place as everyone at the front desk were so friendly and helpful particularly a shout out to the shy and very sweet Matthew. They do have things you can borrow from weight scale to clothes steamer, but only a handful so it's usually checked out. Parking downstairs but they have a 24 hour shuttle that can take you around town.petitejetsetter,It was a pleasure accommodating you recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and we sincerely appreciate the glowing review! I have shared your feedback with the team (highlighting Matthew) regarding your experience and will strive to make sure we are exceeding all of our guests expectations. Please let us know when you visit next as we look forward to having you as our guest!Sarah Junge
1581	2	hard to believe that a Hyatt hotel would not have parking for guests - was directed down the street. Ugh. Should be notified on web page of this. Hyatt should consider removing the Hyatt name from this brandRaymond M,Thank you for staying with us at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I genuinely apologize for the trouble you experienced with parking at our hotel and appreciate the time you took to write this review. Please know we continue to strive to meet all of our guests needs and expectations. In the future, we hope you will give us another try and find your stay much improved to the last.Sarah Junge
1582	2	We arrived quite early so weren't surprised that we couldn't check in. We were told the room was clean but hadn't been inspected yet. We took the shuttle to Pike Place Market for a long lunch then put our 85-year-old mother in an uber to go back to the hotel. It still hadn't been inspected so she had to sit in the lobby till it was ready. We were thrilled with our view of EMP, Space Needle and Chihuly Garden. We had a 1-bedroom suite which is just a regular room with a partial wall to separate the sofa bed from the queen beds. We slept 6 fairly comfortably. Twice when we wanted to shuttle back to the hotel we couldn't get anyone at the front desk to pick up the phone. In the afternoon it took over an hour to finally get a shuttle and since it was a different driver he had a different pick-up place. We almost missed it but happened to look around the corner and half a block up then ran to catch it. After dinner when we again couldn't get through to the desk we called central reservations because they always answer the phone. They tried for 20 minutes to get through to our hotel and couldn't. They finally told us to take a taxi or an uber and we would be reimbursed. Sure enough - standard practice. When we got back to the hotel the only person at the front desk told his sad story of being SO tired and groggy because he had worked a graveyard shift the night before and was the only person at the desk for 2 hours. There was the shuttle driver sitting with nothing to do because if no one answers the phone and finds out where he needs to go he can't actually go anywhere. Very frustrating! On the plus side - breakfast was very good. This place is way overpriced though (over 400 for one night) and not the standard one expects from a Hyatt.Dear JenH,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hyatt house Seattle and thank you very much for the feedback. We will use your comments to improve our hotels operations. I am sorry that your room was not ready by the time you returned for your day out. Also to hear your experience with our front desk and shuttle staff is disheartening. The issues you experience will be addressed. Again I apologize that your stay did not go smoothly as it should have. I hope that you will give us another opportunity the next time you are in town and feel free to contact me directly so I can assist with your next stay personally. Sincerely,Jonathan
1583	4	It's a nice hotel, but could use some work. Staff is clearly overworked and they seem short handed. Only 2-elevators and one was not working one day I was there. Only one goes to the parking garage. One day Breakfast was basically out of food by 8:30am, and it goes until 9:30. 45-min wait for a 1-egg omelet at the omelet bar. Rooms are very clean, showers are weak, but a nice size. Bed was good, towels were good. Nice to have a full kitchen even if I did not use it. TV selection is limited, less than most hotels. Rooms were very quiet, could not hear the street noise too much. Ask in advance if you want a view other than a Tram and Mc.Donalds. The Space Needle is on the other side. Overall if you can get a good rate, it's worth booking. No Room Service at this location.
1584	4	Hyatt House Seattle, provided a pack n' play crib and a high chair, perfect for our one and half year old. The location is directly across from the Seattle where there is a playground, the Space Needle, Science Center and a myriad of things for kdis to explore. Bonus was that it is also next door to the Monorail which we took everyday and did not need to take out the rental car once.Adelina P,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. We pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.Sarah Junge
1585	5	I don't usually do reviews, but we were very pleased with this hotel. It is literally right across the street from the Space Needle and a few walking blocks to the monorail to get downtown---could not have asked for a better location. We even walked down to Olympic park. On top of that, our room was perfect---a small kitchen, 2 queen beds, and a comfy pull out sofa---perfect for my family of 4 (2 teenage daughters). The free breakfast in the morning was excellent. They had a big variety and you could even special order an omelet. My husband and I also enjoyed the evening happy hour. Right next to the Space Needle is the Armory with a wide variety of places to eat. This was a perfect, inexpensive option for our family. Would definitely stay there again!!Dear Gail H,Thank you very much for taking to write a review about your stay with us. We appreciate all the feedback we get. I am very happy to hear that you and your family found our hotel great and the hotels location, comfortable rooms and breakfast buffet. Also that your husband enjoyed our awesome happy hour :) I will share with the staff your kind words and we will celebrate them. We know you have many choices of hotels to pick from here in Seattle so we thank you for choosing Hyatt House. It is great to hear you and your family would definitely stay with us again! We do appreciate your business! Sincerely,Jonathan
1586	1	I entered the room with an overlook of the gas station next door, which was ok however the homeless guy that hung out and got drunk all weekend was the worst. I not only had to hear him from my room , but when I left the hotel to get something from the store I had to deal with him as well. It is clear the hotel cares for the front end of the building but won't deal with that back. Not worth the stay.Dear johntraveler1980,Thank you for staying with us at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I genuinely apologize for the trouble you experienced at our hotel and appreciate the time you took to write this review. Please know we continue to strive to meet all of our guests needs and expectations. Please know the items brought to our attention are being addressed with the Seattle Police Department.

1588	4	We stayed at the Hyatt House for five days at the end of June, a scant two weeks after the hotel opened. It is located on Fifth street and fronts Seattle Center.Room: The room was well designed. It is designed for longer stays and thus has some basic utensils, cook top and dishwasher. We didn't do any cooking but it was convenient to have a freezer compartment that actually worked. We availed ourselves of some ice cream from downstairs and kept the remainder in the freezer for the next night. The bed was very comfortable, better than most hotels. The shower was large. We saw some electronic controls on the wall that simply said My. It turned out that they were for the electric blind controls on the windows. It seemed to us that travelers shouldn't have to guess what controls in a room do. They should be labeled. This is a small complaint for a room that otherwise was well designed and quiet. We slept well here.Internet: I tested the up and download speeds and got 33 megs down and almost the same speed for upload. Very good internet function and was easy to logon.Housekeeping: We did not get any housekeeping one night and on another a harried housekeeper who was supposed to get off at 4 PM knocked on our door at 830 PM and asked if we needed service. They seem to be short of housekeepers and it struck us that they are asking the housekeepers to do too much. I suspect that they are not paid enough either. Morning Breakfast: The breakfast was quite good. We often stay at the Hampton Inn down the street and the food here was much better quality. You even get real scrambled eggs here versus egg food. The juices were good and cold. They have an innovative cooling table that all of the juices sit on and it worked well. The design of the eating area could be improved. Sadly, now that this hotel is open it will be unlikely that changes will be made. They store the plates overhead in the middle of the buffet line. It is an awkward place to have them and would be difficult to access for shorter customers. The buffet line area is too narrow. When people are on the omelet side they often bump into the people on the other side. This seems like an odd oversight. You would think architects for Hyatt would have this down by now. Overall though, the food was quite good and included in the price of the room.Hotel design: The main lobby area is quite pleasing to look at and use. There are ample chairs with modern design and were quite comfortable. The check in desk was ok but I often wonder why they make their staff stand all day. Hyatt could take a cue from Hilton hotels in this regard. The snack kiosk next to the check in desk was well stocked and we used it several times. The hotel elevators are inadequate. They only have two elevators. There often were lengthy waits, particularly on the weekend when the hotel was fully booked. This is another flaw that can't be remedied and it is a surprise again that the architect failed so badly on this item. There is only one elevator that goes to the parking garage, the one on the left, again a miss. The garage is oddly designed, probably because the hotel is on a triangularly shaped lot. Even though we had a compact car, the parking spaces are far too narrow making it difficult for parking and getting in and out of your vehicle. You also have to make a 90 degree turn to either enter or exit the garage, This is after you descend the steep entry. There are some large bolts protruding from the card reader mount at the bottom of the garage entrance. Since you have to make a sharp turn on leaving I can see that someone with a larger vehicle may run over one of these and puncture a tire. Fortunately for Seattle, it snows infrequently, but I could see where some blowing snow could drift down into the very steep parking garage entrance. Someone entering could then slide all the way to the bottom where they would hit the roll up door.Staff: The staff were pleasant and helpful. They looked fatigued and understaffed. I suspect this will improve as the bring more employees on board. We saw one manager who was on duty all day and was there at least until 10 PM when we walked through the lobby. He was there again the next morning when I left the hotel at 0800.Miscellaneous: They accept dogs here. There is a 75 charge per stay. This seems steep if you only stay for one night. We had no problems with our golden retriever and it was conveniently close to the Seattle Center for dog bathroom breaks. Pickup bags are available on the street. Summary: We would likely stay here again when we visit Seattle. I suspect the start up problems will be resolved soon. The morning breakfast was quite good but they need to resort things so that access is better. The rooms overall were great, well designed and comfortable. The staff are harried, hopefully they will have an adequate number of employees soon. The hotels in Seattle seem very highly priced. Our room was 254 and I see now that the rate has risen to 400 per night. Enjoy your stay in Seattle, this is a hotel you would be very comfortable staying at!Dear Thomas K,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your visit on TripAdvisor.

1589	5	Great hotel. Amazing location! Right across from all the top sights museums. Quick walk to the market! The fridge in the room could be bigger but everything else was great. Nice, clean, new hotel. Free Breakfast Buffett was a great bonus!
1590	5	I have to first say, I have been staying in just about every Hyatt in the U.S. But the staff at the Hyatt house is hands down the Best !!! I came in for business training. And on the 2nd day my car broke down, after the stress with AAA. Mind you, the hotel staff picked me up, even gave me a ride to pick up my car!! Look I have seen far and beyond going out of the way...but they gave me a peace of mind. And even took the price off the parking!! I mean they didn't have to, it was not their problem. But took the time to help a guest out... On top of that, you can't beat a better view to sleep with than a view of the space needle. Just want to say this is a great place a home from home why I keep coming back !!! Great job gals/guys and thank you! Dear KaylaNGerardW,Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be.

We very much appreciate your business and hope to see you again hopefully soon! Sincerely,Jonathan
1591	5	The hotel was clean and new looking. Great location with hearty breakfast. Coffee served all day for free and shuttle service available for close by excursions. Rooftop views were great. Staff was knowledgeable and helpful. I would stay again. Right across the street from space needle was perfect. Dear heidbZ5966PW, Thank you for taking the time out of your day to write a Trip Advisor review of the Hyatt house Seattle. We are very happy hear we were a great surprise and that you enjoyed our location and roof top. I will pass on to the staff your kind words. We are happy that you would stay with us again. We appreciate your business,Warm Regards,Jonathan
1592	3	Overall, decent hotel to stay in. The kitchen didn't live up to expectations. The shuttle service was not very convenient. But it was close to a lot of attractions. We were able to see the Space Needle from our bedroom, and were within walking distance to many forms of transportation.Dear Danielle C, Thank you for completing a review on TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be.

I hope that you had a great Honeymoon and we hope to see you in the future!! If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly!Sincerely,Jonathan
1593	5	The best place I've stayed while travelling abroad. The staff are friendly and approachable. The room was amazing! They have a great continental breakfast that's so much more than just a few muffins. And the location is ideal. You're out of the downtown core but the monorail is right there. The Space Needle is right across the street and lots of good restaurants just around the corner. We got in really early and they checked our bags so we could explore while they got our room ready and we did the same thing leaving as we had a late train departure and they were happy to keep our bags while we spent the afternoon out and about. I have nothing but good things to say about Hyatt House.
1594	5	This is the idea location, across the street from the space needle. Large, very clean rooms with large bathroom. Amazing breakfast buffet and bar. Lots of other eating options nearby although you will have to find them on your own. Free hotel shuttle will take you downtown.
1595	5	It is close to the major attraction Seattle has to offer. If you enjoy walking the public market and the first Starbucks is close enough for a walk as well. The hotel is green and it very much reflects that the institution is responsible in terms of doing its part to protect our environment. My family and I enjoyed our stay and hope that we had more days in Seattle than we did..
1596	4	This hotel is right across the street from the space needle and right near the monoreal. Very convenient. Close to restaurants and bars that u can walk to. Rooms are nice. Clean. Took a while to get into our room. Almost 430., but they held our luggage. Bar was good at happy hour for prices, otherwise drinks were expensive. The cost of the room was extremely high and not worth it in my opinion but i guess u pay for summer and cruise season and the space needle area.Bar did not have the night food they advertised. Could not get any munchies.Breakfast was nice and had a nice selection.
1597	5	Great location near everything we wanted to do with clean rooms and great service! The breakfast and omlet bar was delicious. They also offer free rides to and from the hotel within one mile. I will stay again! Dear 814isaiahc,Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be.

If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. We very much appreciate your business and hope to see you again soon! Warm Regards,Jonathan
1598	3	The hotel is nice and the rooms are really nice as well. Staff wasn't as friendly as you'd expect. The elevators weren't working at the time of our stay which was a huge inconvenience. It would be a great hotel of they made some changes.Dear 131gabrielu,Thank you very much for taking the time to review our hotel on Trip Advisor. We appreciate all the feedback we get as it helps us improve our hotels operations. I am sorry that the elevators were down while you were staying with us, I understand that that would be a huge inconvenience. I hope the next time you do visit Seattle you give us another chance as we would love to be given the opportunity to try again. I assure you our elevators will up working fine and you will have a great experience with us!Best Regards,Jonathan
1599	5	The hotel was kept very clean. Staff was very helpful, I was able to leave my luggage in their storage even after I checked out to do some more sightseeing before my flight. The buffet breakfast was great, they had something slightly different each day with plenty of choices. The only downside is it's a little pricey.Thanks so much for the great review, Carliss! It was our pleasure to have you here and hope we can have the privilege again sometime. Safe adventures to you, wherever you may travel!
1600	5	We stayed here only one night, but I have no complaints. Great location. Hotel was clean, breakfast was amazing, and staff was very friendly. Nice views of the city. Would definitely recommend this hotel.Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel! I am very happy to hear the you had a great stay and thought the hotel staff was very friendly and hotel clean. Any time we get a 5 star review we celebrate it here at the hotel. This is what we strive for.We hope to see you next time you are in Seattle and thank you for the recommendation! Sincerely,Jonathan
1601	5	Wonderful stay, very clean hotel with wonderful staff and the best location and view in Seattle. Convenient to downtown, the monorail station is right in front of the hotel. Great breakfast included as well an added bonus!
1602	5	Great hotel neat and tidy Close to attractions Mono rail at door srep and space needle acroos road G react bfast although a little hectic Could do with more front office Starr as often on phone rather than answering customers at counter highlt recommend though
1603	5	Really helpful, fun and friendly front office staff. My room was perfect - lovely view of the needle and Seattle Centre. Studio option was a brilliant choice.

1605	5	We had a great bed, a well equipped kitchen, sitting room with television that you could pivot to the bedroom. The shower was a great one for sure. The breakfast was very good with a chef who made omelets to order. The hotel is close to the Space Needle and park. Parking was reasonable for a downtown hotel. The staff were very helpful.Hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did.Mike H,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

1611	5	This hotel is beautiful and the courtyard is huge and nice. The location is great, close to Jackson Square and Bourbon Street. There is no restaurant, but it's close to so many places to eat that doesn't really matter. Also, it's relatively easy to get to by car.HI Brennan, review like yours are what we strive for! Thank you for taking the time to share your valuable feedback, we appreciate your kind words and look forward to welcoming you back to the Big Easy soon.
1612	5	From the street, it doesn't look like much. Inside, it has plenty of character. Rooms were nice and clean. Courtyard is closed in and safe. People were smoking or sipping cocktails there. Walking distance to Bourbon Street (4 blocks). Stayed on a Wednesday at a very reasonable rate. My wife would love this place. For the price, cleanliness, character, and location, had to give it 5 stars.Thank you for choosing the French Market Inn, we're delighted to hear that we exceeded your expectations for your New Orleans stay. We appreciate your kind words about our location and accommodations, and look forward to welcoming you back in the future.
1613	4	This hotel is located in pretty much in the heart of the French Quarter Its perfect for anyone visiting New Orleans for a couple of days. When I booked my room online I was concerned as it was labelled as a windowless room, We were a bit nervous when we arrived expecting a box like room but were greeted to a room which was very spacious, clean and furnished stylishly. As described the room had no windows but the door had a glass panel window so you didn't feel like you were sleeping in a shoe box. The hotel has a lovely court yard area with a tiddly little pool more like a plunge pool really but still nice to look at.Its very calm in the court yard and you can sit out and read a book or have a drink. The hotel is very much a room and board affair there are no dining facilities and the foyer is a bit like a corridor even though the staff are very friendly we didn't see many as only the receptionist and a valet is required this lead to the hotel feeling a little cold at times but that is just a personal observation. One thing I would advise is to consider the parking the hotel offer a valet service but there is a car park opposite on the other side of the road and the price per day is pretty much the same. We
1614	5	The French Market Inn was everything I antispated. It is a charming Inn built in 1833. The rooms are beautiful with the brick walls and exposed beams. The courtland is beautiful. There are two fountains, beautiful plants, places to sit and enjoy the peace of the place.Thank you for sharing your feedback about our historic hotel. We're pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay at our historic property, and appreciate your kind words about our property. We look forward to the opportunity to welcome you back to our French Quarter hotel soon.
1615	5	My boyfriend and I stayed a night here while passing through NO and enjoyed every minute! This hotel has a great location for the French Quarter! Everything is easily accessible and within walking distance. The decor is very well kept! Bed was super comfy ... Even though we had an interior room we really enjoyed our stay here! Also you might as well use the hotel parking so that you can have your car at any time! We will be back!
1616	4	Great location in a historic French quarter hotel. Parts of this Inn date back to the 1700's when it was a bakery. It was eventually purchased by Baroness Pontalba (Jackson Square visionary) who turned it into an Inn to host her many friends and visitors. Each room, floor, wing are unique. We had a king deluxe room on the courtyard side that was clean, comfortable and quiet, even in carnival season. Front of the house staff very friendly. No room service or restaurant, but Pablo's coffee is next door, Cafe Du Monde is right down the street, and there are many other wonderful, near by places for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!. The courtyard is a quiet place to be outside away from the hustle of the streets, the pool is inviting but unheated. If you prefer charm over generic hotel chains, this is a great option.We are happy to hear that you found your stay to your satisfaction and thank you for taking a moment to share your experience. We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future.
1617	5	Loved this place! Simple, small rooms but comfortable for sleeping and relaxing in between jaunts to the French Q. Awesome courtyards with neat fountains, a small pool for cooling off, and don't forget to find the house cat, Patrick!! We are headed back again this summer for the 4th!Thank you for recommending the French Market Inn, we appreciate your loyal patronage. We value your feedback, and are glad you've enjoyed your time with us in New Orleans. We're looking forward to welcoming you back to our French Quarter hotel this summer.
1618	4	Nice hotel at a good price,small rooms but pretty courtyard and friendly staff, I would go back .Easy walking to anyplace in the french quarter.I always wanted to stay at a small hotel like this and not a large chain hotel and I am glad I did.We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay at the French Market Inn.Thank you for taking the time to share your comments. We hope to see you again in the near future. Safe travels!
1619	2	We visited this hotel after booking online for a short weekend visit. The hotel is quite lovely and our room was very clean and cozy. We got a petite room and it was fine for the two of us as we don't require a lot of space. The entire hotel was very clean and the pool and lobby were beautiful. Our check in was fine and we valeted our car for the night. The next morning we called down 20 minutes early as instructed for the retrieval of our car. After 45 minutes of waiting we inquired at the desk to find out what the issue was. We were told they were on it and it would be soon. At that point, we realized the six other ppl standing around were also waiting for cars. They had one valet and he brought 2 cars that no one needed while we were all waiting. Two hours went by and the lobby became packed. Two bellhops were sitting in chairs not doing a thing. At one point, the one was sitting in a guest chair while guests were standing and he began to sleep. We inquired a second time and told the same thing with no apologies at any point. It turned out to be an over two hour wait for a car that was parked in a lot behind the hotel. We even asked for our keys so that we could get it ourselves and they told us the valet had the keys and this wasn't possible. After that we decided to park our own car and not use their valet. We told the front desk and she said that was fine and she removed the charge for our earlier inconvenience. We parked in the same lot and saved 4 by doing so. The night before check out, we asked if we could go ahead and checkout then since our flight was at 4am the next day. She told us no and their would be someone on staff at our departure time to take care of it. Frustrating, but we figured it was policy.The next morning, we got to the desk and the check out clerk told us that all computers were down and there was nothing she could do.Arriving at the airport, we received our final invoice and noticed that they not only charged us for the valet service that they said they removed, they charged us for every night that we self parked. We called and told there was nothing that they could do at that time because the person who removed the valet charge was on vacation and no manager was on duty. Also, we were disconnected during this conversation and had to call back several times because the phone was ringing busy after our disconnection. Four hours later, we were sent a corrected bill via email. No call, no apology, no customer service skills what so over. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless they would like to be treated like their business does not matter. Thank you for choosing the French Market Inn for your New Orleans stay and taking the time to share your experience. Your kind comments about our historic hotel are appreciated. We typically receive high marks for our customer service - apologize we missed the mark during your stay. We are sorry for the difficulties you experienced with our valet service. Please know all of your comments have been passed on to management. We hope you enjoyed your time in The Quarter and hope for a future opportunity to restore your confidence in our services.
1620	5	Hello viewers,I just returned from New Orleans. My home is Richmond, Va. I love both cities. When I'm in New Orleans, I stay at the French Market Inn. It is close to everything in the Quarter and very reasonable. Miss Minnie in the morning and Miss Nancy in the evening will take good care of you. Also, make sure you stop at Walgreens to get your Jazzy pass. For 9 per person you can ride the bus streetcars for three days like a native. O don't have a lot of money to spend on hotels so I seriously love this hotel. It's like coming home after a long day.Thank you for sharing your positive experience regarding your most recent stay at our historic French Quarter hotel and your special mention of Nancy and Minnie! We can't wait to welcome you back.
1621	4	Stayed there form 6/22/16-6/25/16. Location - location - location. The room was clean the high ceiling made the room feel much bigger than it was. Had a room with 1 king bed. Never got back in the car after we checked in due to the close proximity to everything including the cable car lines. The best part was the staff. Nancy at the front desk was awesome helped so much. The rest of the staff seemed like family. Will definitely stay again the next time I go to New Orleans. The only negative was the high price of parking. I recommend you valet park because the public lot across the street is high on weekends goes from 42 a day to 57.We're happy to hear you had a great experience at the French Market Inn! Thank you for sharing your feedback about our service - staff members like Nancy work hard to ensure great guest experiences happen every day. We look forward to welcoming you for your next New Orleans visit.
1622	5	Pretty little lobby. We were kind of discouraged when we realized how far we would have to carry our bags on the winding upper floor, but it was worth it.Charming room which we fit 3 people in just fine. Window facing the river. Quiet except for street noise, but it was fun noise. Within walking distance of everything. Less expensive than most places.Thank you for choosing the French Market Inn and taking the time to share your feedback. We appreciate your kind words about our accommodations and central French Quarter location, we look forward to welcoming you back for your next New Orleans getaway.
1623	5	This is now my favorite place to stay in New Orleans. The location is great. It is 3 blocks from Bourbon St. and 3 Blocks from Jackson Square. It is close to restaurants, shops and attractions. The hotel itself is clean and the staff are very pleasant and helpful. I had an inside room to save a few bucks and I have no complaints. The room was not big, but it was clean and very nice. The air conditioning worked very well.Hi William, we're honored to be your favorite hotel in New Orleans. We appreciate all of your kind words and look forward to welcoming you back time and time again!
1624	5	My friend and I were able to walk to just about anywhere we wanted to go during our stay in New Orleans. The hotel has lovely rooms and a very nice pool and courtyard...perfect for relaxing any time. The staff was warm and always helpful, especially Nancy and Dean. We would absolutely stay at the French Market Inn again.Thank you for choosing our historic hotel for your stay in the French Quarter. We value your feedback about our historic hotel's accommodations, amenities, and the special mention of Nancy and Dean. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!
1625	5	i chose the french market inn for my 10 day vacation with friends and family and i am most pleased with my choice. specifically i was looking for a great location, a quaint local place and excellent value. FMI totally deliverers.as everyone has stated you cant beat the location. close to the start of tours and many french quarter must sees. whats extra nice though is the ability to get away from from the crowds and constant party. lovely courtyard and little pool and fountains for relaxing outside. its made up of various buildings and each are unique in their own right. be aware that some do not have elevator access. i had a deluxe queen room. i would say its probably smaller than expected, fine for 2 people. it is true that the only window was in the door but it did have nice room darkening curtains. big walk in shower with good water pressure, good cable and wifi. and finally, this is a great bargain. booking early i got an excellent price and was only charged one night in advance. definitely the most reasonably priced hotel at this location.i would like to add that absolutely everyone there was very friendly and helpful. a most enjoyable hotel. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. Your kind words are appreciated! We hope you enjoyed the remainder of your time in The Big Easy!
1626	4	Loved the location of the French Market Inn right on Decatur, yet away from all the noise. The room was extremely comfortable for both of us. Bathroom was impeccable. Wi-fi was perfect and of course we loved Patrick! I just wish there was a complimentary water for the first night.Thank you for choosing the French Market Inn and taking the time to share your valuable feedback. Please know that all of your comments have been passed on to our management team for review. We appreciate your kind words (and so does Patrick) and are glad you enjoyed your time with us in New Orleans! We look forward to welcoming you back soon.
1627	5	We absolutely loved staying at The French Market Inn! The inn itself is charming, rooms are clean, and their customer service is second to none. If you are looking for a taste of New Orleans with exposed brick and a lovely courtyard, this is the place. Only two things to be aware of...there aren't mini fridges or microwaves in the rooms. And the walls are kind of thin. I had no issue with noise whatsoever in my room, but my daughter had some slightly loud people next to her room. We did not take issue with that as you will have that anywhere you go.The Inn is within walking distance of everything and it's the only place we will be staying from now on. Keep up the great work FMI...!!!Excellent, Cheryl! Thank you for your recent stay and for sharing your love for French Market Inn. We can't wait to welcome you back to our historic French Quarter boutique hotel on Decatur!
1628	4	I stayed here with my wife for three nights and we really enjoyed this Inn. The people who work there are extremely helpful and friendly. Ask Lonnie for recommendations on where to eat. The room was clean the beds were comfortable and the surrounding grounds are absolutely beautiful. Patrick the cat is a wonderful mascot who I'm quite sure tires of all the attention by the end of the day. The location is perfect.
1629	5	Great boutique style hotel. Just down the block from Cafe DuMonde. Parking charge 29 night, we parked across the street in public parking for 19 night, you have to cross the street but for 10 night not a problem. Everything was lean and nice
1630	5	Do not have enough great things to say about the inn. We had never been to New Orleans before and were very nervous about finding the right place. Once again, trip advisor led is in the right direction. Everything was perfect from the staff to the courtyards, to the room, to the location. We were a little concerned that we had no window in our room but it ended up being a blessing in disguise after partaking in generous amounts of libations in the evenings. We will be returning to New Orleans next summer and will without a doubt stay here again. Thank you to the friendly and knowledgeable staff for helping to make our stay so memorable. Reviews like yours are what we strive for! Thank you for choosing the French Market Inn, we're elated that your first visit to New Orleans was an amazing experience. Providing memorable experiences is a huge part of what our staff does daily, and we appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback. We look forward to welcoming you back to New Orleans next summer.
1631	4	Staff was so friendly- from checking in through maid service- everyone was wonderful. We arrived a bit early to check in and they stored our luggage and we hung out in their adorable courtyard. Short 2 minute walk to Bourbon St, but away from the noise which is fantastic. And a short 2 minute walk from the Mississippi as well. Lost one star because our room didn't have a window. We did have a skylight which sorta made up for it, but felt a little confined. We hardly spent time in the room since NOLA has so much going on and the courtyard for when we wanted to relax. We would definitely stay here again! We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback about the French Market Inn, and are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay in New Orleans. Our interior rooms are our best value accommodations, and clearly indicated as windowless at the time of booking. Thank you for your kind words about our service, central french Quarter location and hotel amenities. We look forward to welcoming you back to the Big Easy soon!
1632	5	We just returned from a stay at the French Market Inn. It was, to say the least, Amazing! Fantastic location, wonderful staff, and great atmosphere. Nancy and Lon () were amazing, welcoming, and friendly! If we ever head back to NOLA, we WILL stay here again!!Hi Jackie, we're happy to hear you enjoyed your visit to NOLA! Thank you for choosing our historic French Quarter hotel for your getaway in the New Orleans French Quarter, we look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel soon!
1633	4	This hotel was very quaint, as it is in one of the older buildings. Rooms are a bit small, since it is an older building. The price was good, especially considering the location is right in the French Quarter. The maid service left a little to be desired, as it appeared they did very little in the way of vacuuming. Would still consider staying here again though, as the concierge and front desk service was very good.Hi David, thank you for choosing the French Market Inn and taking the time to share your valuable feedback. Our hotel typically receives high marks from guests for our housekeeping service, and we apologize that our staff missed their mark with your stay - please know that all of your comments have been passed on to management and are being addressed. We're glad you enjoyed your time with us in New Orleans, and look forward to welcoming you back soon!
1634	4	As stated in my previous review this is me my husband's go to hotel in the quarter. However this stay had a few issues. We arrived in New Orleans on Sunday, and made it down to our usual parking spot about 2 in the afternoon. We normally park in the lot across from the hotel, so we have access to our car and don't have to deal with valet. The parking lot has since been taken over by another company, and the weekend rates have doubled. It would have cost 45 a night to park in that parking lot. So I called the hotel to request valet and they wouldn't take our car until 3 p.m. So we had to pay 10 to park in the parking lot for one hour. We made it to the hotel valet at 3 and my husband had to stand outside in the heat with a car for close to an hour waiting for the valet to take it, as they were busy with check ins. The total time it took us to check in and get the car taken care of was close to two hours. Our overall stay at the hotel was still great, and the quality of the room was the same. However just be aware that the parking can be frustrating and expensive. Also, the day you are checking out you have to get your car out of valet by noon or they charge you an additional 20 no matter how long they keep it past noon.
1635	5	The French Market Inn was fabulous for our girls trip from Jenna, the friendly front desk clerk, to the super clean room to the adorable courtyard. Request for extra blankets was taken care of right away. There was an issue with our tv working properly and three different people worked to get it taken care of. Everything was very clean in the room and in the public areas also. The location is super convenient for walking around in the French Quarter. The front desk recommendations for restaurants and tours was spot on.We're thrilled you had a fabulous girl' weekend in the French Quarter! Thank you for choosing the French Market Inn and taking the time to share your feedback, we especially appreciate your praise of our staff service. It was a pleasure welcoming you to New Orleans, and we hope you will be planning your return soon.
1636	4	Me and my sweetheart had a wonderful time. Nice warm room. They changed us to a window where we could people watch. Lots of help and a great location. Parking across the street a little pricey but convenient. Probably less expensive with their valet.Thank you for sharing your review. We take pride in providing French Quarter charm to our visitors, and we're happy to hear we impressed you! The cost of our valet service is 34 per night plus tax 38.51 total. Thank you for your feedback about our historic hotel's accommodations, we hope to welcome you back soon!
1637	4	It is always nice to book a hotel based on reviews and it turns out well. This hotel is in a great location , close to many of the sight that people want to see in NewOrleans. The hotel is quaint and the staff we dealt with were all friendly. We did however request a room on the upper level and tat did not happen. They put us in a room that felt like a storage room with foot traffic going past continoiusly. I would be very aware of this.
1638	5	We loved our stay at the French Market Inn! The location couldn't have been better. We could walk to Bourbon, Magazine and Frenchmen street. There was plenty to do on Decatur St as well! Nancy and all of the staff were great. Highly recommend!Hi Jenna, thank you for sharing your love for our historic hotel! We appreciate your feedback and hope to welcome you back to the French Quarter soon.
1639	3	This is a great hotel, if all you're going to do is sleep there and then be out and about in the French Quarter the rest of the day. The bed was comfy, the rooms were fairly quiet (in June--I have no idea how crazy it gets during Mardi Gras), everything was clean, and the water-pressure in the shower was good. Oh, and the service was great--very, very friendly. And as everyone else notes, it is indeed walking distance to just about anything in the French Quarter or downtown.I would definitely have rated it five stars/excellent, if it weren't for two things, each of which lose it a star:First, to get to our room, we had to walk through the outdoor courtyard. That by itself would be fine, except the courtyard was where everyone went to smoke, and smoke they did. I really don't appreciate having to sacrifice my lungs just to get to my room. They should make the entire property non-smoking.Second, having read the other reviews here about making sure to get a room with a window, we paid extra for a room with a Courtyard or City View. The room we got had nothing of the sort. It did have a window, but that window was elevated at least five feet off the ground and only had a view of the roof of the building next-door. It was fine for us (we just wanted some natural light), but it was definitely not what we reserved.So to sum up: great hotel, just be prepared to inhale some second-hand smoke and don't expect to actually look out your window. (But you're in NOLA! Go outside and see the city instead of looking out your window!)Thank you for sharing your feedback about the French Market Inn, we appreciate your kind words about our staff service and central French Quarter location. We do our best to place our guests in accommodations that meet or exceed their expectations, and apologize that you were disappointed - due to the nature of our historic property, we have a level of variance in our room types. If our employees are alerted to an accommodation issue, we are happy to switch rooms when availability exists. Please know that all of your comments have been passed on to management, we look forward to welcoming you back for your next NOLA getaway.
1640	4	My hubby and I stayed here last summer. It is an affordable, no frills place. The staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was comfy and quiet. No bar or restaurant but you are in the Quarter with plenty of those near by. The pool is small but nice. The wifi is a bit spotty. They do have vallet parking.
1641	5	Beautiful spot on upper Kaanapali. Some of the best snorkeling right in front of the hotel. Service and food was great. Service was also awesome. Ate at the bar by the pool one day and our server was slow........was still nice a struck up a conversation with her and it was her first day/ hour on the job. Considering that we adjusted to just have her bring drinks when she saw ours were half empty. No harm no foul.....ITS Hawaii time.Aloha Christmas P, Thank you for your review. We're pleased you got to dine with us and enjoy the ocean. We look forward to your return. Malama Pono (take care)!
1642	5	Large spacious Villas, perfect for Family to stay comfortably. The Staff was friendly and not pushy to sell the Villas. We loved the properties lay out along the Ocean front and it was lovely to see the Whales come down the channel from our pool chaise loungers.Aloha techscout2018,Thank you for your review. Our staff will certainly appreciate your comments. We are excited to hear that we have met your expectations and look forward for the opportunity to welcome you back. We wish you a wonderful upcoming Summer and thank you again for your feedback.A hui hou! (until we meet again)
1643	4	I stayed 3 nights here in a two bedroom suite. It was phenomenal. Two washroom with two separate bedrooms, living room, washer and dryer and full kitchen. They stock the kitchen and provide detergent for laundry. It is great for families or guests staying more than a few days. The resort was very clean and customer service excellent. Everyone was very helpful and nice. Shout out to King at front desk for hooking me up with this upgrade suite. The pool was good size with 3 jacuzzi. I like that its beach front so the kids can bounce from pool to beach within a few feet. We purchased water and groceries at the Times supermarket about 2 mins drive fromThe hotel. They have cooked food there as well. We didnt get a chance to try the restaurants on site so Im unable to comment on them. Theres a coffee shop with some fresh fruits and next the front desk. Coffee is about 4 and decent. Overall i was happy with my stay but when we were checking out, I went to the front desk to confirm my balance and to close my account. I was told my balance was 40, which was right due to 15 parking and some coffee I ordered. Two days later, I see there is a credit card charge on my account for over 1000! The room was prepaid AND I made sure to check my account before leaving. So I have no clue what happened with this. I have left a message and awaiting for a call back to rectify this. The worse part is that I was charged the exchange rate for that day and foreign fee on my credit card when there should have never been this charge in the first place! So in regards for billing I dont know what to say. I would have said make sure billing is right before checking out but apparently that doesnt make a difference as I made sure of my final bill before I left to only be charged 1000. Aloha Mmark 8,Mahalo nui loa for your review. I believe we have your billing error all worked out. We apologize for falling short of our expectations with up to the minute billing. Please reach out to a Guest Service Manager should you need further assistance in this matter. Again we thank you for choosing the Westin Nanea Ocean Villas and for recognizing King for his assistance. Malama Pono (take care) and we hope to see you again.
1644	3	My wife and I are owners here - and while the GM was fantastic in trying to make our stay right - I really hope the Food and Beverage service poolside is improved before our return next year. We heard from many other couples around the pool that had the same concerns and even the management staff when we commented on it said they knew it was an issue and were working on it. Three different managers said this. That said - Chris (the GM) addressed our concern and was fantastic. The front desk staff, housekeeping and bell staff were also very good. Their service at the Westin North property pool side is much higher at this time and I hope and expect that Nanea will get there soon. When you are on vacation you tend to spend a lot of time at the pool and thus was poor service there really stands out. Thanks Aloha Scott S,Mahalo for your review and your gift of feedback. Our General Manager, Chris Rabang, is always willing to go above and beyond to assure that each and every one of our guests is well taken care of. His leadership is a prevailing factor in our property's enormous success, despite only being open for 7 months. With that being said, we do regret that our Food and Beverage service did not meet your expectations. We will diligently address this issue and continue to improve our service. We hope that you will give us another chance to exceed your expectations.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)
1645	5	Absolutely beautiful, full kitchen,large tub, beautiful bathroom,bedroom spacious, double bedrooms, was a free upgrade I think, grounds lovely, Last trip was for purely relaxation and destressing which we accomplished.Appreciate the non pressure sales to buy in the timeshare program. You had to go to them, not the the other way around. Already have a timeshare with Westin.No desire to add on more maintenance fees. Definitely would recommend going down to this resort is just lovely down there even though we went on the tail end of the last tropical storm it still is just wonderful .Aloha Mae456,Mahalo nui loa for your great review. We are delighted that you found beauty and relaxation during your stay despite the tropical storm. As you know, we can't have rainbows without the rain and this last storm certain made the most exquisite sunsets and rainbows galore. We look forward to seeing you again and again. A L O H A
1646	5	Perfect family vacation. Resort location was wonderful. Great snorkeling right outside the room. Easy shuttle transportation from the resort to Whalers Village and Lahaina. The staff was very helpful and willing to do whatever necessary. Gorgeous room with a well stocked kitchen. Best vacation in a long time. Aloha ebonniksen!We are so very glad to hear that you enjoyed yourself while staying with us, and that you were able to experience some of our amazing snorkeling on Ka'anapali beach. Mahalo for all of your kindness. Return very soon to build onto these Maui vacation memories. Mahalo nui loa,
1647	5	We had a private chef over for my husbands birthday and the kitchen amenities and room view did not disappoint. It was comfortable for six people and the hotel had a high chair for our toddler to use throughout the trip. Room cleaning service was prompt daily and proactively called to see if we needed service on the one day we stayed in. Thank you! Aloha 27Lei!Wow! What an amazing experience. I am so happy to hear that you had such a wonderful time while staying with us and that you enjoyed the villa and amenities. A hui hou!
1648	5	We have been staying at the Westin Kaanapali resorts since 2004. Each resort gets better than the last. Nanea is the ultimate. Keeping the culture of the islands from the lobby to the rooms. Staff is all friendly and helpful. Concierge staff is knowledgeable. Cant wait to be back!Aloha nancyfQ2296HJ,Mahalo for taking the time to provide a review on your recent stay. I cant agree with more the Cultural Center is a great and informative tour that you cant miss as a speaks life to the Hawaiian Culture. We appreciate your stellar review and recommendation to other travelers. We hope to welcome you back soon.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)
1649	5	The resort was fantastic with something for the entire family! The pools were amazing for the kids to play in, the food and drinks were great for everyone, and the suites were perfect for our family. The staff made an effort to go above and beyond to ensure our family enjoyed our stay!Aloha beachkyle11,Mahalo for your comments about our family friendly environment. We appreciate your recognition of the friendly staff. We are delighted to hear that you had a wonderful stay and we look forward to welcoming you back.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)
1650	5	We had a fabulous vacation in Maui in this beautiful resort, Westin Nanea. I was impressed with the 2-bedroom villa, very spacious for a family of 4 with nice furnishings and the heavenly bed was just that - heavenly. This resort is truly Hawaiian, intentionally designed to reflect the culture and history the lobby itself is remarkable with detail in the woodwork, fish baskets, circular posts representing the elements, and so much more. We enjoyed the pool and the view of the ocean beach was walking distance! Happy hour offers good drinks from 3-6. Great customer service staff at front desk greeted us with a smile.Blinnk photography captured beautiful pictures of our family vacation, leaving us with photos to remind us of this special vacation in Maui! We were impressed with the ease of the photo shoot and the quality of the photos. Definitely recommend Blinnk photography! Overall, best vacation ever at the Westin Nanea! Highly recommend. Family friendly, beautiful resort that gives you relaxation and luxury. Thanks for the wonderful service that made our vacation memorable!Aloha Catherine A,Mahalo (thank you) for your review, recommendations, and sharing that your stay at The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas was the Best Vacation Ever! We love that you soaked up the sun and our Hawaiian culture. You are so welcomed and we hope to see you again soon. ALOHA!
1651	5	This property has an excellent location on the beach, wonderful walking path along waterfront.......The accomodations service of the Westin is one of the best ......Staff extremely friendly helpful both on site in recommendations for local activities on the island......Aloha D2897ZNkathleens,Mahalo for your review! We are delighted that you enjoyed our close proximity to the beach. There is nothing more peaceful then walking along our expansive beach walk. Thank you for the kind words regarding our friendly and helpful staff. Our kuleana (responsibility) is to share the island of Maui with all who visit us. We are eagerly awaiting your return.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)
1652	5	Stayed here last week-end with a group of 7 ladies and was extremely pleased with the room, the staff, and the location. Our junior suite was comfortable, good size, quiet and immaculate. Slept great on the comfortable bed. Front desk staff was very friendly and willing to help with purchasing tickets to the Atlanta Aquarium and Atlanta History Center and even offered discount tickets. Lobby was modern and inviting. We used one of their meeting rooms for 3 days and was very impressed with the view from the 12th floor room. Pitchers of ice water and glasses were delivered every morning with a smile. Will definitely return in the near future!Thank you very much for recently choosing our Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta Midtown. We are glad to hear that you and your group had such a great stay and were able to utilize our 12th-floor meeting space. We just love that view as well. Thank you for leaving your review here on Trip Advisor and we look forward to seeing you all again soon.
1653	5	This hotel staff understands how to make their guest feel at home. The front desk staff-Juan, Ryan, Jessica and Taqua, along with the valet attendant-Mike, were amazing. The housekeeping staff is also amazing. This was the best customer experience that I have received in years.Thank you so much for staying with us, Q6508QNsandraj, and thank you for such a great review of your stay. We are so happy that you enjoyed the service you received so much. Our team truly takes pride in offering a guest experience that exceeds their expectations and makes them feel like an appreciated guest. Please know that those team members mentioned by name will receive some additional kudos from us as we realize how hard it is to make such an impact that a guest feels inclined to spend their time leaving a review and then mentioning them by name. Safe travels, and we hope to see you again soon.
1654	5	Right on Michigan ave so great location, easy to get to everything. Amenities were fine for this price point. But the service was off the charts everything we wanted or needed from picture taking, to a late night snack of chocolate was taken care of and usually by Myron Jackson he was just fabulous. Thank you for making our stay memorable, comfortable and accomodating!!Dear FranklinFilly,Thank you so much for your recent 5 star review. We are so happy that you enjoyed your stay. Our team members are the ones that make guests stay go above and beyond. Myron is Magnificent and is our Front Desk Supervisor. We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us.We look forward to seeing you again soon!Kindest regards,Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager
1655	5	My husband and I met friends in Chicago recently for a three night get-away. We stayed in a one bedroom suite on the 21st floor. The room was fantastic...large living room/kitchen with a separate bedroom and a beautiful view of the river. The room even had a washer/dryer, which was very helpful. The location is perfect...right on the Magnificent Mile, close to the Chicago River, Grant Park, Millennium Park, great restaurants and shopping. The hotel staff were very helpful, accommodating and friendly. In short, I would highly recommend this hotel!Dear LaurenW11,Thank you so much for your review. Our staff will really enjoy your comment on the personalized service that we offer. We do have a great location and our hotel room size is one the largest in the city. We hope to see you soon!Please tell me if I can personally make your next reservation.Best Regards,Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager
1656	5	Never, I repeat, never, have I ever experienced the personal attention I received at this hotel. The director of sales (Patrick) and sales manager (Kristina) went over and above to make sure that my stay was the best it could be. I was upgraded to a 2 BR suite and they bought me tickets to a Cubs game (which I reimbursed them). Their willingness to help plan my days were unparalleled.This hotel is a tremendous value, considering its ideal location on Michigan Avenue and its price which includes a small breakfast. I recommend it without any reservation.Thank you Jeff for your kind words and for your business. It was a joy helping you and your family plan your Chicago trip, both Kristina and I would like to have you all come back and visit us again next summer!
1657	5	I have traveled a lot and I didn't think I would think much of this hotel but I was pleasantly surprised. Literally the pillows were so comfortable I contacted management and bought some for my bed at home! Awesome stay!Thank you for your review, I am so glad you were pleasantly surprised with your stay and loved our bedding. We would love to welcome you back and please feel free to contact me directly for any needs!
1658	5	I stayed here for a week with my daughter while she was auditioning for grad school. The price was reasonable, it offered breakfast and had a washer/dryer so it seemed perfect for us. I was expecting a small room but we got a HUGE room with a kitchenette, washer/dryer and lots of closet space. The breakfast was perfect for us with lots of choices of items. The staff was always welcoming and the beds were really comfortable. I couldn't ask for a better room. It was conveniently located between all of the areas we needed to go and there were restaurants close by. It was also very close to the train. I would definitely stay here again and I highly recommend it. It looks unassuming from the outside but you'll love what you get inside.Dear sgilmore61,Thank you so much for your recent 5 star review. Our hotel rooms are some of the largest in the city. We are so glad that you enjoyed the service and amenities of the property.We look forward to seeing you again soon!Kindest regards,Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager
1659	4	Stayed for 10 days. No problems with lifts despite being on 23rd floor. Room was quiet, Except for the air con (every hotel seems to have super noisy aircon) and spacious and comfortable. Didn't need the cooker but the hob looked a bit the worse for wear. Breakfast fine and with decent choice. But the waste from everything being disposable! Space can be at a premium after 0800 even with the overspill into the conference room but we always got a seat and table. N.B. Water needs to be hot not warm to make a good cup of tea, not always the case atbreakfast or at the coffee/tea station behind the lobby. Overall a good choice as so convenient for the Loop/millennium and Grant Park and Magnificent MileDear Jane W,Thank you for your recent review. I am delighted to learn that your stay was to your satisfaction and that you enjoyed our spacious suites, amenities, location and our service. On behalf of my team, we look forward to your return visit from England.Kindest regards,Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager
1660	4	Great value for business or leisure travel..comfortable and roomy, clean rooms. Good breakfast include. And parking was very convent . Staff was very helpful. We plan on using this location in future.Dear Sam G,Thank you for your recent 4 review. We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed our breakfast and the teams service. The hotel is great location for either leisure or business guests.We look forward to seeing you again soon!Kindest regards,Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager
1661	4	Overall a very nice experience at the Comfort Suites. Positives: The staff were ALL incredibly nice and helpful. Rooms were clean at check in. Washer and dryer in the room was a terrific perk, and came in handy with a week long stay. Nice breakfast - simple, but always had fresh fruit, yogurt, oatmeal and then the usual cooked items. Location could not be better, lots to see and do in the area, and lots of dining options.Not such positives:Daily housekeeping could do a better job - cleaning off kitchen counter, throwing away used coffee cups, etc. Rooms are a bit dated, and the sofa bed is in serious need of a new mattress (could feel every spring). Air conditioning was not great - especially in the hallway near our room. Only 2 elevators (tall, narrow hotel) so sometimes had to wait quite a while to get back to our room (or down to the lobby). we were on the 20th floor, so walking down stairs was not a great option.Dear TravlinGal1959,Thank you so much for your recent 4 star review. Thank you so much for your great positive comments on the team members, room being clean at check in and our amenities. Next month all of our sofa's will be replaced with memory foam mattresses and new sofa's. I do applogize for this experience but we are working on replacing them. We look forward to seeing you again soon!Kindest regards,Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager
1662	4	I read other reviews after my husband had done research and made reservations at the Michigan Ave Comfort Suites. Now that I've spent two nights there, I can tell new readers what to believe.The good: 1. The location is excellent. Close to El stations, downtown shopping, the river, and the park. There are good restaurants nearby, like Sweetwater, as well as a couple of fast food places. And if you need something for your mosquito bites, Walgreen's is also very close. But if you want any groceries for the little kitchenette in your room you will have to either bring them with you or find City Groceries about three blocks away.2. The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful. Ask them anything--they just want to please.3. The suites are quiet and have a bedroom with a very comfy bed, t.v., washer/dryer, as well as a living room and kitchen with a t.v. It felt like a little apartment. There are lots of windows, but not all of them have a great view many of them look on to other buildings.The not so good: 1. ELEVATORS. There are only two VERY SMALL elevators for 26 floors, and during our stay one of them was out of service. About 25 of the time, the elevator was too full and we had to wait (and wait!) for it to come back. This can really slow you down. Of course, there are stairs, so if you're fit and on a low enough floor, this might not be an issue.2. BREAKFAST. Comfort Suites offers a free continental breakfast that is quite mediocre. Poor quality (cheap) sandwich bread for toast, stale donuts, bagels, and pastries, cereal, waffles, sausage links, scrambled egg patties, juices, coffee, and fruit (only apples and bananas). It's a busy place in the morning and it's over at 9:00 am.So, in my opinion the good outweighs the bad and I can recommend this hotel with this advice: 1. Ask for a room on one of the lower floors, and 2. If a tasty breakfast is important to you, do some research and find a good restaurant.Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience. We cannot thank you enough for your understanding and patience during the elevator issue we experienced. We certainly try to put our best foot forward and apologize for this inconvenience during your stay. We apologize that the breakfast offerings did not meet your expectations. We would certainly be delighted to have another opportunity to have you with us and experience a flawless stay. Please do not hesitate to contact us when your travels next bring you to Chicago.Safe Travels,Natalie Furka-PadgettGeneral Manager
1663	5	Recently stayed here, after taking a red-eye and arriving at the hotel first thing in the morning. Even though the hotel was turning over at least half the rooms, they found a way to get us into a room by 11:30 AM. Steve Saenz at the front desk, and Nadeljka in the breakfast room were especially helpful and accomodating.I am so glad you found our staff helpful and accomodating and enjoyed your time with us. Thank you for your business and review.
1664	3	The front desk staff was so nice and helpful. The rooms are all suites and are spacious, clean and comfortable. The best thing about this hotel is the location. You are working distance to EVERYTHING.Thank you for your review and business. I am thrilled you enjoyed our unbeatable location, friendly staff and spacious suites. Please visit us again soon!
1665	4	In town for the marathon. Location was perfect! Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful! Loved that they had signs for marathoners and a personal note. The elevator broke on day one of our stay, but was fixed quickly. Loved the decor on the inside and how they kept parts of the old Chicago Motor Club. Our only issue... More
1666	3	Chose Cumberland Mall area since it was very close to people we were visiting. First, the hotel staff at front desk were very cordial and welcoming, give them an A! Main complaints was the bathroom tub and sink. The tub looked like there was mold...MoreDear Bob C, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We truly appreciate your feedback and are very sorry for the condition of your room and quality of our breakfast. We will address your comments with our...More
1667	4	We enjoyed our stay here for the most part. The basics were all covered: friendly staff clean room comfortable beds and we slept well. However, the dining area for the complimentary breakfast was too small for the size of the hotel. It was packed by the time we checked out around 8:30 am and so I'm glad we ate breakfast early!
1668	5	The hotel was nice and quiet. It was in a good location--not far from the Cumberland Mall. There wasn't too much traffic. The Breakfast was excellent. There wasn't a parking fee and it wasn't crowded--lobby or parking lot.
1669	5	I am a Hilton fan and try to stay at Hilton hotels whenever possible since they have a great member rewards program.This Hampton Inn was great and I would stay here next time I am in town for business. The check in was smooth and flawless, the manager on duty acknowledged that I was a Hilton Honors member and was very pleasant.The breakfast was up to par, always clean and staffed by a very nice, upbeat attendant.The fitness center was clean, had a few machines but they were in working order, there were plenty of towels and bottled water. Nice touches.This is a convenient location, close to Cumberland Mall it's a short walk with plenty of dining opportunities.Also, there were cookies near the front desk, again nice touch.I'll be sure to stay here next time I'm in town.
1670	5	We went to Atlanta for a business meeting and the Cumberland Hampton Inn was recommended to us. The hotel and staff were great and we loved the complimentary breakfast. Will definitely staff there again.
1671	5	I can say this is best hotel I have visited in a while. My arrival was great I was greeted by the front desk and I was informed I was the vip guest of the day, my treat included all types of snacks and goodies. The staff was nice and they serve a wonderful breakfast and appetizers in the evening. I can truly say if I am in the Cumberland area I will be staying at this hotel.
1672	2	Was not able to run hot water from shower - was told by staff just to let water run for 20+ minutes and then it would be hot. Quite noisy at night with cars honking, sirens, etc. Didn't get much sleep. Was just traveling for a work conference, so not needing anything fancy in terms of accomodations, but basics like warm water and a good night's sleep were missing!Dear Jessica W,I appreciate the review of your recent stay at our hotel. Im very sorry that we fell short of your expectations. I hope you give us another chance to serve you if your travels bring you back to our area. Please know that we value your business and will work hard to earn your trust once again. Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience. If you would like to discuss further, please feel free to call me at 404-589-1111Hospitably Yours,Andrew May General Manager
1673	5	We were delighted and given such care. The gentleman that helped us with our van and even when we needed to get back to it :) Service was great, professional and friendly. Nice amenties, Awesome breakfast-restaurant quality, very clean, would definitelyrecommend and return. Right acorss the street from GA Tech- for a beautiful walk. Only downside - not all ice machines were working.We're pleased you experienced our Southern Hamptonality and Atlanta's charms.
1674	3	Location is great with several nearby landmarks, hotels and restaurants. Parking is adequate and convenient. All staff encountered were courteous and friendly. Breakfast was what one would expect from a Hampton and changed a little each day, which was nice. Room was noticeably smaller than other Hampton Hotels I have visited. Minor maintenance issues noted such as shower that dripped constantly and toilet that had an obvious leak causing the valve to open to refill the tank several times each hour. Hot water was slow to reach the faucet and wasn't consistent. Room also had a noticeable odor that resembled wet carpet that had soured. Overall, just an average experience but nothing that would keep me from returning...just might request a different room.Dear Byron H,Thank you for taking a few moments to write a review about your recent stay. I appreciate your feedback and have shared your comments with my Chief Engineer and Housekeeping Director so they can address the issues you pointed out.Looking forward to welcoming you back soon!Hospitably Yours,Andrew May General Manager
1675	4	Hotel was clean and quiet... Some slight traffic noise but I chalk that up to big city traffic and not the fault of the hotel. Breakfast was great each morning and the complementary food was a nice touch later on in the day (By the front desk) We wanted this location because it was close to the park, gulfarium, Meehan's , and Skyview.Dear Mattme34,Im so glad you enjoyed your trip to Atlanta. Thank you for pointing out our convenient location to a few of the local attractions.We hope to welcome you back soon! Hospitably Yours,Andrew May General Manager
1676	4	The room was nicely decorated in a contemporary fashion but it was the smallest hotel room I've stayed in. The room was just large enough for the king bed and a small table. They had a sitting chair, but it just made the room look cluttered. There really was no room for the chair. The staff was nice and helpful. If you don't mind not having a lot of walking space, then this is perfect.
1677	5	I had no complaints I was in town for court and this was a great location and the price was very affordable. The staff was very helpful and even held my bags while at court in case I didn't arrive back in time.
1678	5	We stayed in the Hampton Inn for the first leg of our holiday and were very impressed. The staff were professional and helpful, the accomodation (top floor suite) was excellent and the breakfasts of a very high quality.Dear Lee R,Thank you for taking the opportunity to post a great review about your recent stay here at the Hampton Inn Suites Atlanta Downtown. I am glad you enjoyed our breakfast and found our staff to be professional and helpful. We hope to welcome you back soon!Hospitably Yours,Andrew May General Manager
1679	5	We arrived around 2:30PM from a long drive from our home in NC to the Hampton Inn-Downtown Atlanta at 161 Ted Turner Drive NW. Be advised, most maps and our GPS did not recognize Ted Turner Drive, it was named Spring Street. I was quite surprised how easy it was to navigate the traffic and enter their parking lot. Once we parked, we never moved our vehicle until we left on Thursday morning. If we hadnt been staying at hotel, we would have incurred a 20 per day parking fee. However, the Hampton Inn waived this fee and gave us a parking pass. Make sure you place unobstructed on front mirror. The parking lot owners will put a boot on any vehicles with expired or non-stickers. It was very easy to recover a luggage cart and transfer our stuff to the hotel check-in station. We were very impressed how clean, and efficient the hotel lobby was. Princess, the hotel manager worked tirelessly checking us in. It is always so nice to sample fresh cookies and enjoy hot beverages during this process. We stayed in a King Bed Suite on the 5th Floor in room 513. This turned out to be an excellent location selection within the high rise building. We not only experienced solitude and quietness but I felt very secure. The amenities in our room included a separate sitting area with extra TV, refrigerator, and a microwave. Our room was maintained at an excellent state of cleanliness by very courteous and interactive housekeepers. If youre searching for a great hotel which is very close to Olympic Park, public transportation, and sights like aquarium, CNN building, and the World of Coke this is the one for you. The hot breakfast that is served free from 6AM to 10AM daily was one of the best tasting, excellent choices, and smoothly efficient that I have ever seen. Given the oodles of hotels that we have stayed in over the years, this one captured our amazement and our respect. I would definitely stay here should we return to Atlanta.Thank you for providing this valuable feedback. Our team will be elated to know that your stay with us was enjoyable. It was our pleasure hosting you, we look forward to your next visit to the Atlanta area.At Your Service, Natasha BoydGeneral Manager
1680	2	The location of the hotel is convenient to downtown Atlanta, and the cost of the hotel is reasonable. However, one of the elevators was broken and staff said that it had been out of order for 3 weeks. This meant using the stairs, and my room was on the 8th floor. My room lacked a shower curtain, coat hangers in the closet, and was not clean when I arrived.Dear David C,I appreciate the review of your recent stay at our hotel. Im very sorry that we fell short of your expectations. My apologies on your experiences with the elevator. Shortly after you checked out the repair work had been completed. Unfortunately the required parts are no longer manufactured so custom pieces had to being fabricated causing a longer then anticipated repair time.Again, I do apologize for the inconveniences and I hope you give us another chance to serve you when your travels bring you back to our area. Please know that we value your business and will work hard to earn your trust once again. If you should have any further questions, please feel free to contact me directly.Hospitably Yours,Andrew May General Manager
1681	4	In Atlanta on business and Kim Jones at the front desk was SO helpful! Great personality and helped me get what I needed to resolve a paperwork issue - couldn't have done it without her! Nice touches at this property. Nightlight in the bathroom! Microwave in the breakfast area available any time (which is great for late night popcorn).Thank you for staying with us in Downtown Atlanta. We're pleased you felt our Hamptonality. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!
1682	3	I made this reservation only because the Hilton around the corner, was booked for the weekend. Hampton Inn's normally being consistently clean and consistent, I decided to make the reservation. The staff at the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful, all shifts, while there. The room was small, noisy. The television never worked the entire stay. We have to call someone from the hotel, every time we wanted to turn it on! Some issue with the cable or buttons in the back, it was nothing but fuzz. When they would come to fix it they would say I think that's got it and then we would have to call again. There was a piece of debris on the tile floor in the entry way, never got cleaned up the entire stay. How do you not see a piece of dark colored debris on a light color tile floorThe hot water and pressure in the shower was an issue, just as I have seen others report on this site. Took forever to get hot water, no matter whether AM or PM. Pressure very low. This was a leisure trip and regardless, it would be nice to have all of the necessities you pay for when away from home.Dear Janice E,I appreciate the review of your recent stay at our hotel. Im very sorry that we fell short of your expectations. I hope you give us another chance to serve you if your travels bring you back to our area. Please know that we value your business and will work hard to earn your trust once again. Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience. If you would like to discuss further, please feel free to call me at 404-589-1111Hospitably Yours,Andrew May General Manager
1683	5	The lowest price reservation online seemed to be a handicap room. So I took it. At room selection time, I let Hampton select the room and found that I was upgraded to a 2 room suite at the original low price. Thank you Hampton.
1684	3	Our room had no heat, no hot water, and staples coming out of the carpet in one spot. We were moved to a new room which still had no hot water and had the bonus of a broken phone. The staff issued keys to other guests for that room, and three older ladies were shocked to open the door and find a baby sleeping in their room. We reported all of our issues, of course, and the staff did their best to compensate us for the inconveniences. They eventually helped us find a different hotel, negotiated a discount rate, and paid for our cab to get to the new location. We appreciated the exemplary staff, but we were bothered when we realized the hot water issue had been going on for several days and they were STILL not disclosing the situation to customers as they checked in. That was disturbing. The silver linings of this stay...... clean space, good breakfast, gorgeous lobby, and a staff that was accommodating and helpful (but perhaps not completely honest).
1685	3	The amenities were lacking, no microwave or refrigerator in room. The price was also misleading, when you add in the parking fee, taxes and hotel fee the cost of the room increased by about 90 a night.On behalf of our staff, we would like to apologize for not having refrigerators and microwaves in all rooms and the inconvenience that this caused you. If your ever in the area again, we hope that you would give us another chance. You are a valued guest and we appreciate the feedback.Thank you,Michelle Lopez General Manager
1686	5	This is a wonderful hotel to stay if you are in the Atlanta downtown area. First, look for discounted rates with Hotwire.com. The staff is pleasant friendly. They will make sure you are comfortable satisfied during your stay. I was so amazed at how fast they met my requests. I requested a roller bed light bulb for the bathroom night light the demand was met before I could blink my eye. The lobby is well lit nicely decorated. They have flat screen tvs, pillow top mattresses, modern bathroom countertops freshly painted rooms with accented colors. The room smells clean fresh, new carpet the halls are nice clean.Oh, and they have full course breakfast every morning. Not continental but everything including bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes, breads, cereal, fruits, coffee, tea etc. That is a plus. They have courtesy internet fitness center. And you are within walking distance to all the major tour sites such as Coca Cola, CNN, Aquarium, Olympic Park etc. Ok, I've said enough to make you choose Hampton Inn Suites, Atlanta Downtown.
1687	5	Chris (and Eddie) at the front desk were quite the ambassadors for Best Western. Clearly the position is his vocation and not just a job. Chris was polite, patient and helpful to guests. He helped direct us and solved a minor problem for us. It was an excellent stay and we will be coming back again prior to our next... More
1688	4	We stayed here because we like Best Western. It offered a shuttle to the Miami Port and that worked out great. Check in was fast and friendly. Our room was nice and the bed and pillows were really comfortable. The not so great part was the location of the room being a few doors from the main lobby. A loud... More
1689	5	Angel and Luis were very professional and helpful when checking in to the hotel. They were friendly to my children and very welcoming. The room was very clean and pool was great. All staff was kind and courteous. I recommend this hotel. Quaint and quiet. Great customer service!
1690	5	As usual Hampton Inn service was exceptional. The staff was friendly and helpful. Free parking under the hotel is VERY tight but is convenient to the hotel rooms. The hotel is very close to the marina, good food and the ferry. Five stars!!!I am so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. We look forward to your next visit, take care. Sincerely, Jared Bolan Guest Services Manager Hampton Inn Suites Bremerton
1691	1	The room was not clean and smelled of smoke. We did not stay and they would not refund us as we were told that we paid online and could not be refunded.
1692	4	Nothing really special here but the rooms were updated and clean and the people were helpful and friendly. The rooms were quiet. The location is good for the Lindale Mall area. We had a family dinner at nearby Biaggi's and it was tremendous. There is no view outside the east windows - all you see is the wall of the... More
1693	1	I could not believe my eyes when I went to plug my phone charger in and I see a nasty balled up pair of women's dirty underwear, I was in shock to say the least. We travel very often and have had some interesting experiences, however I have never seen anything like this! After plugging in my phone and disposing... More
1694	5	My wife and I love visiting LA, and just got back from a trip we took with friends. It was our first stay at The London, and I am positive we will be going back the next time we find ourselves on the west coast. The room was great and felt spacious even for four guests. The complimentary breakfast was... More
1695	4	I stay at the London every few months, when I come in for business and it always feels like more of a vacation. To the rooms, service, staff, food everything is always four star!! My husband was sick and they had the hotel dr call and got us meds from pharmacy. They did everything in their power to make his... More
1696	4	Right on the water. Large, clean rooms. Breakfast buffet was reasonably priced and the bar menu adequate. Valet staff efficient and fast. three minute walk across the bridge from the Convention Center and five minutes from the arena.
1697	5	We only stayed one night as it was a stop-over to our next destination. I was very please with the accommodations and the service. We arrived late due to horrible traffic but the staff was great and the check-in and check-out was very quick and easy. If traveling again well definitely stop here again!
1698	5	Needed a room quick. They were very helpful. Great room, clean, up to par and breakfast was good. They front desk clerks on check in and out very pleasant and helpful. Would stay again with no regrets.
1699	5	This hotel is currently under renovations in the lobby area so they have set up a temporary front desk in the convention center. Check in went quick and easy. There are none of the tower guest rooms affected by this. The room was clean and had a very nice view with a balcony. The bed was very comfortable and the... More
1700	3	We just stayed here while my husband was on business, and we brought the family to join since it's a great family location. While the room was clean and available for early check-in with a cranky baby, the rest of the place seemed very run down. We were also extremely disappointed to find out when we arrived that the main... More
1701	2	we booked this hotel via hotwire, the only thing good about this hotel was the location, it was very close to the disney world area, the quality of the hotel was poor, parking lot dirty, room smelled HORRIBLE, the ac stopped working in the middle of the night, the breakfast was crappy. If you get it in a little late at night, there is no parking available with some lighting only spots out back in the dark. would NEVER go back.
1702	1	Hi, my family and I were having a vacation at Walt Disney World so I decided to stay in Baymont Hotel only for it's photos that can be found online because there was a lot of hotels with the same price per night in the city. First, there was a misunderstanding of the people that made my reservation that were more focused in grabbing your money out of your pocket than helping and listening to the guest. They were pushing me so hard to reserve a room instantly that they did not hear when I said 2 nights. When I got to the hotel, The front desk agent helped me to get another night that wasn't in the reservation. The hotel was nothing to do with the online photos. The carpet was old, stained, dusty, and had bad odors the Lobby was dark. When I got to the room It was disappointed. The whole room stink, the carpet was all dirty and stained. The furniture old and scratched. Bathroom with hair in the floor, towels with holes. Beds were full size not queen. Pillows small and flat. Also I visited the pool which was dirty and with tree leafs in the bottom. I took breakfast in the morning it was small, No eggs, sausage, bacon, milk, only a basic breakfast. What I did like was the quietly of the room the friendly staff, nothing else. I will not come back again to this hotel, and I can not recommend it to anybody. Sorry, that's the very true. Sincerely Mr. Morales ( Security Manager of MIA Hotel)Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your constructive feedback. Our intent is to give great quality at minimal cost to you our valued guest. We ask that you please bare with us as we continue to improve the quality of our hotel while we are undergoing renovations. Our ultimate goal is to provide all of our guests with enjoyable, and memorable stays! So we look forward to having an opportunity to make your next stay just that! Thank you for your patience once again and we hope to see you soon.
1703	5	I stayed here for 2 nights with a friend of mine while we were attending the Grand Rapids Comic Con. I am a Red Roof Employee myself and as such get a special rate when I book with the employee travel voucher. Unfortunately when we arrived I found that I had misplaced the voucher! Luckily the manager Ami (I think... More
1704	2	Th price was cheap but the whole area doesn't look safe or proper for a family. The room looks clean but it smells. The only person staff that I found was nice and polite. There are many mechanic shops in this area.
1705	5	I stayed during the weekend , room and bathroom was very cleaned and I breakfast was awesome . They have hot breakfast (pancake , scrambled egg ... ) and so many item on breakfast menu . Nik a manager was really helpful during my stay , he recommended few places near by St. James winery , fantastic caverns and Public... More
1706	5	We spent a timeshare week here, and this is one of the most enjoyable stays we've had at a resort. First of all, the location is beautiful. The resort is a couple of miles off the main road, nestled among the pines. As described by so many, the cabins are phenomenal. The living area, dining area, and bedrooms are tastefully... More
1707	3	By the time we planned our trip, the Theodore Roosevelt hotel was already booked and this was the only hotel that was still available. I do like higher end hotels, but I was prepared for the worst after talking to the reservation agent...I knew it was going to be rustic and outdated. It was...and it reminded me of staying in... More
1708	4	I frequently travel to the Carmel Westfield IN area - this is one of my favorite places due to the staff friendliness and the ease of access (now that construction is more or less done on Meridian). Look for AAA or other rate deals for the best price. Rooms are large and place is generally very quiet.
1709	2	Stayed here on business. Don't let the outside fool you, the room was nice and clean. The outside is not a good first impression. Everything here is very basic, nothing fancy. The outside definitely needs help. The staff was very nice and accommodating.
1710	4	We chose this hotel for a one-night stay on our road trip due to its convenience and price. It was well reviewed on Trip Advisor, and our experience supported those reviews. The location is convenient, off of a major interstate, and the rooms had everything we needed for a safe, secure, and comfortable night's sleep. Despite the proximity of the... More
1711	1	I stayed at this hotel in June 2016. The first room they tried to give me had been broken into by having the screen cut and the window pushed open. The caretaker was concerned but simply retrieved the key to the adjacent room and continued my check-in. When I arrived at my new room the first thing I did was... More
1712	5	This hotel was EXCELLENT - from the entry with the fresh water/cookies to the restful stay / comfortable beds / to the wonderful breakfast - just a great stay and I highly recommend this hotel! The hotel management and staff were excellent!
1713	5	We loved Captain Cook and this place is wonderful. You are basically staying on a big back porch among the banana leaves and serenaded by frogs (so not for those who need to sleep where it is totally quiet). The breakfast was wonderful (they grow all the fruits and the coffee) and the tour amazing. You get a real feel... More
1714	5	We have stayed here many times and would highly recommend it to everyone. The rooms are all wonderful, each with a different theme. They are large and very clean and have wonderful bathrooms. The best part about staying here is the wonderful staff. It is located in the picturesque town of Mc Cloud. Just lovely in every way, you would... More
1715	4	This hotel was decent for the cost and the staff was very friendly. However, the room was smaller than I would have expected although it did include the basic amenities (e.g. coffee pot, hair dryer, microwave) which did help. The room included a front sitting room with a TV and couch and I was happy to have the separation from... More
1716	4	it appears this hotel is brand new and the condition reflects that. the rooms were clean and nicely appointed. the lobby area was modern and had everything you could need. the breakfast area was large and the food was good with a made to order omelet station. This is unheard of for a hotel of this price range. there is... More
1717	5	I booked a stay at Savanna Inn Suites for a one nigh stay online with Trip Advisor that directed me to Expedia.com at which time I booked a room and got a printed conformation. I arrived at the Inn and show them my conformation letter at which time they said that they had no reservation for me. They check... More
1718	5	I spent a sleepless nite in an airbnb oven ....it was miserably hot with people coming and going, traffic sounds, barking dogs, on street parking and noisy neighbors. Said the heck with it and checked into The Days Inn Oceanfront Maui! What a revelation! A cold shower, a cold AC, a fridge and micro, Turner Movie Classics, secured parking, and... More
1719	4	Don't confuse this location with the extended stay location which you can see at the freeway offramp. this location is around the corner. It is quiet, clean and comfy. I can't ask for more from a budget chain motel room. The rooms are updated and modern, although I think the bright orange wall will get old quickly.
1720	3	I read so many scathing reviews on this hotel, that I only booked one night when I needed three. Once I saw the room and the view, I quickly booked the other two nights. Seriously people, what do you freaking expect for 50 - AAA rate for an ocean view king I know of an RV park down the road... More
1721	4	I can't say enough positive things about this hotel! I was very impressed with the cleanliness and quality of service that was offered. We checked in a little late and the Front Desk associate that greeted us was wonderful. I think her name was Bonnie Jo. She made sure our requests for the second floor were granted and explained the... More
1722	4	Lovely hotel with very clean and comfortable accommodations. The hotel staff was wonderful. Kind and accommodating. The breakfast was delicious! I ran into one problem with the billing. I had stayed for one night. I was billed twice. One payment was settled as paid. The other continues to be under a pre-authorization after 5 days. I was assured by The... More
1723	4	We really enjoy this hotel. The staff is helpful, the room very clean and the location is perfect for walking around Athens. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 rating this time is because the bed was hard as a rock. We saw the next morning that it apparently was adjustable, but we went through a terrible night.
1724	4	Hotel is fine and restaurant accommodations were very nice. Internet leaves a lot to be desired, but fortunately we were needing to conduct business on this trip. Staff could not be more professional or ready to help in any way possible.
1725	5	I stayed at this hotel for business this past week! Upon arrival was greeted by two amazing and friendly front desk agent and I am so sorry I didn't get their names. Went to the room very spacious changed and went to dinner on advise from the front desk they gave me a great dinner spot. Came back and discovered a/c wasn't running cold called the front desk they said they were full and couldn't move me handled it well though and in the morning the GM already new I had a problem and offered to make it right it was nice to not have bring it up again. We asked for a late check out and the GM was very accommodating and made it happen even though they were sold out so thank you I know how difficult that can be! It was a great location and the breakfast was the best I have ever had even compared to the ones I pay for. Usually when I go to Orlando I stay at the Gaylord Palms for way to much but I like the service from now on I will be at the Comfort Suites They went above and beyond! Very Clean and great value pretty pool area Like I said I'll be back in two weeks to bring my kids during spring break and I'll be canceling my reservation at the Gaylord and staying there again and I recommend you do too!!!
1726	4	For those of you that have read my reviews in the past, you know I don't pull any punches. I give my honest opinion, good or bad. We visited Orlando this week and needed a place to stay near Universal without breaking the bank. This hotel received numerous good reviews and the price was right, so we booked for 3 nights. To me, service makes all the difference, because most hotel rooms are generic. We are a family of four, and two Queen beds used to work just fine. My son is now twelve and is getting too big to sleep with. While at the front desk, we asked Alain if we could have some extra blankets to make a pallet for our son. He started tapping on his computer and I'm thinking why does he need to look on the computer to give us more blankets'. Turns out he was giving us the suite next to our existing room for no extra charge. My son felt like he had his own little apartment! Way to go Alain! Add comfy, clean beds, a nice pool/hot tub and decent breakfast and you get a reason to save hundreds of dollars while in Orlando. Two miles from Universal and twelve from Disney.
1727	5	Comfort Suites Downtown is great. Writing this from the room before checking out.It's in an easy to get to location just off i4. There's a Panera Wendy's only a few steps away for food. Continental breakfast included omelets, corned beef hash, potatoes, blueberry or regular waffles, plus all the fruit, cereal, breads, etc.Room is great. Comfy, clean and roomy. Great bed and pillow. Love all the plugs for laptop and cell phone. Alarm clock radio even plugged into my iPhone and acted as a speaker.There's an outdoor pool and jacuzzi too. I didn't use it, but many people were enjoying it.No complaints here. Would stay here again for sure.Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your stay at our Comfort Suites. We appreciate your feedback since it helps us improve our service and your experience.You are a valued customer everything we do is aimed at providing you with an excellent stay at our hotel.I appreciate your business and hope to see you again in the near future.
1728	3	I stayed here for 4 nights with 2 other people, and overall, it was a good place to stay for a trip to Universal. I have only one complaint: the air conditioner in the room. First, it was LOUD, which was very annoying at night. Secondly, we had a double room, and the bed closest to the unit is very close and is directly in the path of the cold air. I slept on this bed the first night and froze, I slept here on the second night and woke up with a terrible sore throat, which really sucked all the next day in the park. Other than that, everything else was fine. The hotel is clean, the heated pool and hot tub was great at the end of each day when you're really sore from all the walking in the park. The free shuttle and breakfast was also extremely helpful. The traffic in the area is crazy at night, but there's lots of restaurants, pharmacies, etc. in the area.
1729	4	We have just stayed here for 3 weeks and had a fab time! Hotel room clean and comfortable. Everything we needed there inc a fridge, iron, hairdryer, decent tv channels. Breakfast was great! A healthy choice available. Hotel staff really helpful. Pool area was nice and quiet. Would definately recommend this hotel and would stay here again if back in orlando.Thank you for taking the time to write a review about our hotel. We are delighted that you enjoyed your time with us and hope you will visit us again soon.
1730	5	Though I came during an High School something of another I was worried that my stay here would be disturbed by noisey kids....WRONG! I slept like a baby...I missed breakfast however to avoid the traffic but other than that everything was wonderful. House Keeping went over and beyond with hospitality...someone was always at the desk smiling upon entering...it's very close to the main strip where resturants and the entertainment was. Needless to say I 3 this hotel!Thank you for your kind review. We are very happy you enjoyed your stay and look forward to welcoming you back!
1731	4	First off,,, i recommend this hotel, i looked and scoured the internet weeks before my trip from israel. The Room- If its comfort you want, its comfort you get, the beds and pillows were off a very nice quality. The television worked fine, yes you do watch a little t.v on vacation. Lighting was good in the room. No safe that's a shame. Good shower pressure, but the hot water was not as hot., one mention of this to reception, it was taken care of. management does listen.!! Location is excellent, right around the corner, lots of eatery, TGIF restaurant is okay,, big selection. but the asian buffet is better, for 12 all you can eat. Check it was easy enough, alain was very nice, and helpful. The room had a musty smell,, we did not complain,,, opened the window,, within a day it was gone. Breakfast--- ahem,,,,, well,,,,,like in previous remarks from others,,, its definetly overcrowded,,,,,which is annoying,,,but this morning into day 3,, they opened up a meeting room,,, for a overflow,,,yeaaaa,, what they should do is build a makeshift extension close to the pool,,, for the overflow,,. The breakfast is poor,,, not enough variation, what would it hurt to make a few salads,,, it would go a long way,,,think healthy.So in the mean time,,, This is a good hotel.... good value for the money,,,nice staff,,, lino at breakfast is very helpful. Enjoy your vacation,,, the hotel is good for all,,,families, couples,,, worth the price!!!
1732	5	Reception staff were extremely helpful. The rooms were a good size and clean. Complimentary breakfast was very good, although only two hot options which alternated daily. The hotel is in a great central location and easy to find. The only negative was having to pay 5 for every package delivered. We will definitely use this hotel for our golfing base next year.
1733	5	This is a friendly hotel with good facilities and a good location. It is the staff that make this hotel stay so enjoyable. Very clean rooms enjoyes stay.Good breakfast. Location is near by major attraction.very convenient location.ThanksThank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We are delighted that you enjoyed your experience and we all look forward to welcoming you back.
1734	5	My family and I planned a trip on short notice to the Orlando area and my wife was a little unsure about staying here as opposed to a more expensive resort. We were both impressed with the cleanliness, staff service, features in the immediate area and a bonus we didn't expect is a shuttle to Universal. It also picks up a few other hotels so takes 20 minutes plus, but saves on parking at the park. This place helped us to Orlando on a budget!!I rated restaurant a bit lower as they don't have one on site. Like most Comfort Inns, they do have a warm breakfast which my kids were getting sick of by the end of the week, but food was good and hot, plus the the price was right!!Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We are delighted that you enjoyed your visit and our complimentary shuttle service. Even though we do not have a restaurant on property there are many choices within walking distance of the hotel from fine dining to fast food. We hope you will visit us again on your next trip to Orlando!
1735	5	We had a pleasant and wonderful stay at this hotel. People are very friendly from the time you check in until you leave. Rooms are clean and beautiful my kids love it! Kudos to the Korean guy at the front desk in the evening of 12/7 he was very nice and friendly.Dear Guest,Thank you for sharing your experience at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium through the Guest Satisfaction Survey.As a Valued Guest, we appreciate your feedback and are delighted to hear that you had a great stay.

Those are often less than two separate rooms so we'll split it with family or friends. The hotel is older so...MoreDear Valued Guest, Thank you for your review.

1742	4	We stayed at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim for one night in April. It was a very nice room for the price. The kitchen was well appointed. The only downside was the temperature control in the living room controlled both the bedroom and living room. I will definitely stay there again. In fact, I tried to book a room there next month and there were no rooms available.
1743	5	My wife and I recently stayed at this property for 3 nights and had a fabulous stay! The location is just a few miles south of the Orange County/Los Angeles County line. You could not ask for a better location all around! The hotel is about a half mile off of I-5 and is right across the street from Angels Stadium. One night we walked from our room to the stadium and made it there in a couple of minutes. I was a bit nervous that traffic might be bad around game time as fans are coming in but I was surprised to see no traffic at all. Disneyland is located about 1-2 miles away. The staff was nice enough to tell us a shorter way over to Disney and we were in the parking lot in under 5 minutes. The staff is top notch! I have never met a more friendly staff. All of the employees had smiles on their faces and were always very cordial and helpful. We did a lot of tourist things up in the LA and Burbank area and where able to make the drive in about 30 minutes depending on traffic. Our studio suite was fantastic! Our room felt just like an apartment! We had a king bed, living room, kitchen, desk/office area, bathroom, and large closet. The kitchen was stocked with everything except the food! We had a dishwasher, stove, and microwave. The room, just as all of the property, was very clean and our air conditioner kept our room very cool. The bathroom was rather large, my wife and I were both able to get ready at the same time without bumping into each other. The hotel offers a daily continental breakfast that is simple and good. They have 2 waffle irons, cereal, muffins, bagels, english muffins, and juices. The area does close at exactly 930 so you need to get there early. Seating is somewhat limited and the area fills up quickly. They have 2 people working to clean the area and assist guests. The one lady who seemed in charge of the area was very pleasant and friendly and was quick to come over to us every morning to welcome us back. The hotel seems to attract business travelers although there were some families there too. It was nice not to have too many kids around and to have an adult atmosphere. There are plenty of restaurants around that range from fast food and casual to fine dinning. Overall, this is a fabulous place to stay! Great location, great attractions, but most importantly a great staff!
1744	5	I chose this hotel for the value provided. Public transportation to the theme parks was easily accessible and timely. The rooms are pretty comfortable and the overall service was just right. My family and I were very comfortable staying here we felt secure and relaxed during our stay.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim. It was truly a pleasure to serve you. We appreciate your business and value your honest feedback. Your comments have been shared with the hotel team as a critical way of understanding how we can continue to deliver exceptional service to guests like you.

Sincerely, Edgar Rivera General Manager edgar.riveraMarriott.com
1745	5	Staff was more than helpful, REALLY clean and comfy rooms, kitchenettes are great, breakfast was really good!! But don't count on the transportation to Disneyland. They sell out FAST. Don't stress, use LIFT!! Costs less, It's quicker and the drivers are all nice. Back to the hotel... we lost a dog while there, still looking for him. The ENTIRE staff took part in trying to find him, either physical search or social media blast. And they consoled my mentality challenged sister. WONDERFUL PEOPLE!! 10 STARS!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL AND WE WILL RETURN!!Thanks for your excellent review of our property! We hope that your furry family member makes it back safe and sound. Thanks for choosing the TownePlace Suites in Anaheim!
1746	1	We booked this hotel months in advance for our upcoming Disneyland vacation carefully taking into consideration all our options of the many comparable hotels in Anaheim. Less than two weeks before our arrival date an email notification came to advise us the pool would be closed for maintenance for the majority of our stay! Now I am aware that this is necessary, however in all of my past experiences any type of scheduled maintenance is clearly disclosed well in advance. Upon a call to the hotel's manager to discuss this concern, no apology or compensation was offered, and she even encouraged us to look into other hotel options! With less than two weeks to go entering a busy season, clearly most hotels are already booked. Very unprofessional and disappointing is my option of this hotel already, and we've not even set foot on the property!
1747	5	Im a 36 year old single mom who travels very often with family. I Stayed here for weekend trip to visit friends in the area. Paid 89 a night for double beds. The staff was friendly and helpful. The Hotel and the rooms are clean and new. The free breakfast is always a plus when you have kids. Thy have a very nice outdoor pool and a warm hot tub. We will probably stay at this location every time we come to Dallas. There was also a Taco Bell, KFC, sonic, Chili's, Walmart and numerous stores and food chains on the exit that are also new to the area. I 100 recommend this Hanpton Inn. :)
1748	4	This hotel was in a central location and one could easily walk to the museums (MODA) up the street. The MARTA was close by for easy transit around Atlanta. Leave the car in the paid lot and walk the 2 blocks to the MARTA to get to your destinations. The hotel is a serviceable Residence Inn with a clean, plain lobby. We had rooms on the 7th Floor and the ceilings are very high with exposed pipes so that was nice to look up at once you were in bed. However, the air conditioner was LOUD, and while successful in drowning out street noise, it was extremely hard to get used to when going off to sleep. The breakfast is well done and actually there was a sausage hash that was very tasty along with red bliss potatoes, onions and peppers that tasted wonderful. The exercise room was decent and provided a good workout. The pool is small but was great for the kids to splash in.
1749	5	We were taking the train home to Los Angeles, and this is the closest hotel to the Amtrak Train Station. The staff is very good, and the valet took very good care of us, the room was very clean and comfortable.
1750	4	5 of us ladies stayed in the 2 bedroom/2 bathroom suite. The kitchen area consisted of a microwave, oven and refrigerator. Plenty of space in the main area and bedrooms (small bathrooms though), comfortable bedding, clean, friendly staff, complimentary breakfast each morning. I also loved room service requests were filled immediately (extra towels). The only downfall is parking, which valet of 30/day is your best bet if you don't want to risk getting a ticket. Easy walking distance to a few restaurants and the corner store. You can't beat the location and great price so I would recommend and would definitely stay again! We really appreciate the positive feedback! Parking is not our favorite thing either but it is in-line with our area. We are actually are one of the cheapest. I'm sure the readers appreciate your review on possibly getting a ticket if you decide to park in the public areas. I'm sure it will be helpful for others. Thank you,Devin H
1751	5	The hotel is not bad. What sets this location apart form anything else is the attitude of the staff. They are all friendly and helpful. Really great people work here and they seem very proud to be there.
1752	2	We stay at Hampton Inn's often as they are usually decent and affordable. This was our worst experience by far. The room was not clean with visibly dirty pillow cases/sheets and a bath tub that would not drain. The breakfast was also not as quality as our other stays with a dirty serving area and uncooked eggs and sausage. The staff overall was nice and they did appropriately respond to our concerns but we will not be back.Dear Heather, TThank you for staying with us and your time and comments Please accept our sincere apologies for the drain in your room not be working properly. We appreciate your letting us know. The comments that youve raised concerning the items have been addressed with our staff, and I thank you for bringing them to our attention. Please accept our apologies for your inconvenience. Hilton Honor points have been issued to be put back into your account. We know that you have many choices to stay while in the area and we appreciate that you stayed with us. Sincerely, Patricia KilgoreGeneral Manager
1753	3	I can only give you the advice to keep checking in with your reservation. Upon my arrival I had four rooms reserve for business and after we got there I had one. It seem the computer system had given three of te same confirmation out and the hotel was booked up. Other than that it seemed like a nice hotel.Dear Jason H,Thank you for writing a review about your stay with us here at the Hampton Inn-Atlanta Perimeter center. Thank you for your comments concerning your reservation confirmation number and apologize for the inconvenience.! Thank you again for staying with us and sharing your experience with this review!
1754	4	I've stayed at tons of Hamptons and this is one of the nicest I've been at. Everything was very clean and it seemed the rooms had been recently redone. I agree with the other reviewer on the pillows - they were very lumpy but overall the room was nice. I had a king room that had a sofa with it, so that was a nice plus as you don't often see that at Hampton Inns.The staff were great - each morning they never failed to say good morning. The breakfast was also very good for being a Hampton breakfast. They had a rather large spread and everything was well-supplied. The lobby itself is very small, so the breakfast area can get crowded if the hotel is full.Overall it's a great option for the budget and very conveniently located.Dear Annelin PThank you for your kind comments concerning your stay with us. We are happy to know that you enjoyed your stay with us. It is our goal to ensure that all of our guests have a great stay with us. We hope that if your travels bring you back to our area that you will choose to stay with us again.
1755	4	Clean, comfortable room in the Perimeter area of Atlanta. Close to the Mall, restaurants, and other shopping. Breakfast was typical for Hampton Inn. The staff was extremely friendly. We arrived very late at 2:00am and gentleman that welcomed us was outstanding. What a nice way to be greeted!Dear Kim W,Thank you for staying with us at the Hampton Inn Atlanta Perimeter Center. We appreciate your kind remarks and review of our hotel. We are happy to know that you enjoyed your stay with us. Thank you for your time in letting others know about your stay. It is our goal to ensure that all of our guests have a great stay with us. We hope that when your travels bring you back to the area that you will choose to stay with us again.
1756	5	My husband and I were looking for a relatively inexpensive way to stay near MARTA so that we could travel around ATL without using the car all the time. This location was near the Dunwoody stop. The hotel was also near a wonderful Persian restuarant - Rumi's Kitchen. All together, it was wonderful couples getawayDear Toni MThank you for staying with us at the Hampton Inn Atlanta Perimeter Center. We are happy to know that you enjoyed your stay with us and that our area to the Marta station was convenient for you and that you had a great get a way weekend. Thank you for your time in letting others know about your stay. We hope that when your travels bring you back to the area that you will choose to stay with us again.Sincerely,
1757	5	Great value - more than expected.Every thing at Hampton Inn Perimeter was great! The staff was extremely friendly doing every thing they could to make our stay superb! The guest attendants at the front desk are very helptul! The bonus of the shuttle for close proximity was a great help! The breakfast staff kept up with keeping all breakfast items readily available, which is a great feat when the hotel is sold out and breakfast area is attacked by 4 different teams. Rooms just renovated, fridges in each room. Large breakfast area to relax. Meeting rooms available to hold team meetings.Coffee and tea is available 24/7.
1758	1	I booked this hotel due to believing the 700 hotel nationwide presence can screw up in such a big manner. the sofa pull out couch is filthy broken No utensils in the kuchen AC filter accumulated dust about an inch. Missing one portion of the window a kid can fall out of it AC being not effective The management does not care no body responded to the maintenance call for more the 48 hoursYour review for our hotel was recently brought to my attention. I sincerely apologize that your stay with us did not meet our companys high standards. To ensure that a situation like yours doesn't happen again, I will be making sure we are thoroughly inspecting rooms before guest arrivals. While we no longer keep dishes in guest rooms, these items are available upon request at the front desk. Moving forward, I will make sure we are clearly communicating our amenities. Thank you very much for bringing this to our attention. To discuss further, or if you have any questions, please contact me at PERextendedstay.com. Thank you for choosing Extended Stay Hotels. We hope we have the opportunity to see you again in the future.
1759	3	Stayed at The Chelsea over Easter weekend.... Got a promo through living social. Great deal, although it was for the Annex section of the hotel :( Comfy bed, but that's about it. The bathroom ws sooo small, and the shower lacked water presser. Who stays in the room anyway
1760	1	Stayed at The Annex for a night. Room key did not work after we checked I had to walk all the way down to front desk to get another. Room was clean but had a moldy smell about it, I would have left if I had another place to go. The worst part about this hotel is that I put my credit card down to hold the room and upon checking out took care of the stay in cash. Charge was removed from credit card, 2 weeks later charge shows up again and my bank processed it The hotel has been unresponsive and bank will not take the charge off my card I never stay at this hole again.
1761	1	I didn't expect Ceasar's Palace but also didn't expect a view of prostitutes and drug dealers directly outside my window. The staff was rude,the room smelled, the elevator was a thrill ride and the indoor pool was an outdoor pool due to the recent collapse of the roof. Given the choice of sleeping on the beach or this hotel I would take the beach!
1762	1	My fiance and I have a one year old daughter and wanted to have a nice night out just the two of us. I had only heard good things about the Chelsea, and the price range was very good for a Saturday night. We checked in around 10:30 pm. The first room they gave us had a leak in the bathroom, resulting in water all over the floor. The bathrooms were so outdated - like straight out of the 50's tile etc. We called maintenance and they sent us to another room. The bed was decent, but everything else was falling apart. The shower head was coming out of the wall, and when you turned the shower on water leaked all over because there were holes in the tile near the knobs. The light fixture in the room was busted in. It was just grimey and disgusting. Oh, and I can't leave out the fact that our room overlooked the lovely streets of Atlantic City where we heard EVERY car system bumping, people yelling, sirens and other loud noises all night long. Plus the fact that we heard every noise from the rooms next to us, people BANGING on doors, running and yelling down the hallway. Neither of us slept a wink, which was the whole purpose of our peaceful night out. After being up all night, finally at 5 am we proceeded to the front desk to check out. We told them that we never complain, but it was a terrible experience and I even showed them the pictures I had taken of everything that was broken and dirty in our room. Not to mention the entire building smelled like marijuana and vomit. They didn't even give us a refund, nor offered to comp anything. I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN OR REFER PEOPLE HERE! So much for a nice, quiet, romantic night out!!!!
1763	2	Stayed one night on Thursday 7/26. The room and bathroom were clean, although very outdated. We were assigned to a room right next to the elevator, and could hear the rings whenever someone was taking the elevator. We were forced to pay the 15 parking and suffered the long wait for the valet. Not worth it.
1764	1	My fianc and I decided to have a last minute moment of relaxation over the weekend (June 25,2016) before our upcoming July 9th wedding so we decided to hit the beach and stay for an evening. I will say the woman who helped me book over the phone was lovely and the front desk person was also wonderful. We walked into our room at The Annex on the third floor and I walked out after just 15 minutes. The front desk was called and we unfortunately could not switch rooms or hotels so we decided to just check out and leave. The room felt grimy it was scorching hot, cigarette burns on the floor, dirty ceiling and my city view was a garage. It did not smell clean or pleasant. I was so disappointed. The front desk person was VERY apologetic and said he would try to get me a full refund. I saw that this hotel was under the Cape Resorts Group and that is so sad because I have had wonderful experiences at the Virginia Hotel and Congress Hall. This was just a bad experience and waste of money that I may never be refunded, which is awful especially when its just 2 weeks before my wedding and we tried to spend our money as wisely as possible. Disheartened.***Horrible hotel but very nice people working there.
1765	1	I have stayed at The Chelsea once before in the nice tower. While trying to book my trip this time I was surprised. I booked my room online and thought I booked the nice new tower again since I kept clicking on The Chelsea and not the Annex. To my surprise when I arrived I walked into a dirty room with stains on the sheets. The chair in the room looked from the 70's with stains as well, was afraid to sit on the bed. When I returned to the front desk to speak with the manager and get a nicer room in the tower I booked or refund my money, he was very rude and arrogant. He refused to refund and said I booked wrong even though I kept telling him I kept clicking on The Chelsea. The customer service was horrible the room was dirty and needless to say I lost out on 240 for a poor quality room I did not spend the night. Don't go!!
1766	5	We have been to Maplelag several times. Back when the boys were is school we went every winter. This year was a trip down memory lane - only problem was lack of snow but we still skied about 45 km in three days
1767	4	My husband and I stayed here in early June where I was attending a college reunion. Full disclosure...I lived next door for six years and am very partial to the neighborhood. That said, the location is near perfect, close to the Public Garden ,the upscale shops on Newbury Street and Copley Place, Trinity Church, Beacon Hill and an easy walk to the Arlington T Station which will get you almost anywhere easily. It is also very convenient to a host of outstanding restaurants. The Club itself is located in a historic Brownstone and therefore offers only a limited number of rooms. the doubles are very large with newly renovated baths the singles are small and share a bath. The rooms have no TV, but do have WiFi. The office staff is outstanding...knowledgeable about Boston and very friendly. They are present only during the day and after hours, guests enter with a code. Breakfast choices are limited, but sufficient and there is amazingly good coffee from a machine. If you are looking for luxury of the Four Seasons variety, this will not be your cup of tea, but if you are looking for quiet clean accommadations, a bit of Olde Boston and a fabulous residential location, you won't do any better than this. And did I mention that it is a bargain
1768	2	We were really looking forward to staying here. Unfortunately it was surprisingly disappointing. The room itself was very large and picturesque so we cant complain about this but the noise from outside made sleeping impossible some nights. The windows are obviously not double glazed so the noise from sirens was incredibly loud as they went up the street right outside the window. Also no television in the room. I think thats a must now. We dont watch a lot but the option would have been great. Mostly though accommodation is about the people and we felt like intruders in someones house. No good mornings or how was your day when we came in. We realise it was not a hotel so dont expect that level of service but a hello would be nice. Such a shame its in a great location. Sally,I am sorry to hear that you felt unwelcome here at The College Club. We do try to greet guests daily and are always available in person, or by telephone after office hours, to hear and address concerns. We appreciate you bringing your concern to light here and will work to do better in the future. It is true that the noise from outside can, at times, be unsettling. It is an unfortunate fact of being situated on a major thoroughfare in a populated area. Some guests are accustomed to it, some are not. Had we known of your trouble sleeping we would certainly have moved you to a room on an upper floor or away from the street. There is a television in the breakfast room which guests are welcome to use at any time day or evening. We do hope that, overall, your trip to Boston was enjoyable and would welcome the opportunity to have you as guests should you return.
1769	4	Just the best location on a tree-lined street within easy walking distance of the subway and major shopping. More like a B and B than a hotel, it offers pleasant accommodating staff and a homey old-fashioned ambiance. We stayed in the Simmons room which was spacious with a lovely modern bathroom and lots of seating including a chaise. No A/C in 86 degree heat, but they provided a large fan and it was not unpleasant. A wedding and party during our stay, but little noise or disruption. Breakfast in a small pleasant dining room offers a simple but expansive breakfast and having a good coffee machine available anytime and nice cookies in the pm was a nice touch. One thing to remember...best to obtain the keypad code for entry just in case you arrive after hours or on a weekend. We picked the College Club from the Tripadvisor reviews and felt the cleanliness, staff, and peace and qquiet made up for the slow Wi-Fi and lack of A/C in our bedroom.
1770	3	Stayed here 2 nights recently. I thought it was just okay, picked it for price compared to other hotels in the area.Pros:Spacious room (would be a studio if this were an apt)Great location, steps away from the Boston Public Garden, Newberry St, etcGood value, given location and sizeCons:Kinda shabby (not chic): I guess this might pass as quaint victorian to some but it could use a little shine. Everything creaked. By which I mean every single step up and down the stairs, and in my room, and every time I rolled over in bed (which was 2 singles pushed together to make a king).Both:Plumbing: on the plus side, great rainfall showerhead, modern toilet and sink. On the minus side, the shower seemed to have two temps, really hot and even hotter and while the sink fixtures seemed stable, the hardware parts unseen shuddered every time I turned the water on.Breakfast: plentiful, chobani yogurts. But otherwise pedestrian (grocery store breads/bagels/cereal/granola), grape jelly, under-ripe cantalope/honeydew fruit cup, hardboiled eggs.As a solo female traveler who arrived after hours, I would suggest to management putting people's initials or reservation on the envelope with keys that's left in the foyer, rather than writing out guest's names.
1771	5	The CCB is located on Commonwealth Ave, and less than a block from the Boston Public Garden. I appreciated the location and the pretty boulevard in a residential area. This is a classy looking brownstone, with elegant furnishings. The hotel was full when we stayed, yet so quiet. There is not a constant bustle of staff and guests. The service was just right. The room and bathroom were spacious and nicely furnished. We liked the homey touches of CDs and books in the room. I will definitely stay here again.
1772	5	My husband and I visited NOLA for the first time and stayed at the St. James. It was wonderful! Megan, at the front desk, greeted us with a smile and a friendly comment, every time she saw us and was more than willing to help us newcomers find places to visit. She helped us with times, directions, and any other questions we asked ...always with a smile! Our European breakfast was delivered by a very friendly,smiling,waiter and every other staff member we encountered, greeted us and interacted as if we mattered. How refreshing! It is not a hotel for partying people and not located in the hub-bub of that environment...but it is within walking distance to almost everything you'd want: Bourbon Street, Canal Street, French Quarter etc...we walked through all of that and loved it! The room was clean, comfortable and beds are comfy! We highly recommend it to anyone..even newcomers such as we were. We will be going back.
1773	5	I loved staying here during such a busy weekend, and I still got the attention to detail from the staff. Christina and Amy were like my go to gals. The hotel is close to everything and the staff restaurant recommendations were awesomely fulfilling. I can say the bathrooms in the hotel either need a face lift or better cleaning tools everything else I loved.
1774	5	We were in town for a wedding and had 9 rooms. The rooms were all different shapes and sizes. My room was large, with 2 queen beds, wood flooring, and a large closet. One of the rooms in our party had a king bed with a small closet. The beds were so comfortable that my mother wrote down the make and model number. I agree that the water pressure could use some improvement. The hotel is only a few blocks off of Canal Street which made it easy to walk to most of the places we wanted to go. From check-in to check-out we received excellent service. Christina and Cheryl took care of everything we needed, from suggesting restaurants, printing out directions, and ordering a cabs. There was always coffee and ice water in the lobby where we spent a good bit of time visiting with friends and family. My husband and I agree that we will return to the St. James Hotel on our next visit to New Orleans.
1775	3	This is a decent budget hotel (thought not so budget in its price). The room is decent size, the queen bed that I had was comfy, the a/c worked fine, and the room also had a mini fridge and a microwave (I didnt use the latter, so cant testify on its quality). However, I found a few things very irritating. First, the shower. Although the shower-head is decent, you can never know if you would have hot water or not, and the water's temperature changes while you take a shower. It seems that during peak hours, like 7am or 7pm, the hot water will last for 2-3 minutes, and than you will experience 1-2 minutes of cold water, before the hot water resume. But the most diaspointing thing was breakfast - the hotel advertises a free continental breakfast, but reality is slightly different. Every evening you are asked to fill in a form, where you ask when would you like breakfast to be delivered to your door. And than, the following morning, around the time that you ask, give or take 15 min, a person will bring in one pot of look warm, undrinkable, coffee, and one pre-hitted (by microwave) croissant, with a tiny piece of cheap butter and a tiny jar of jam. This is it - that's your breakfast. Every morning I found myself going out and buying breakfast at a cafe. It is not only the taste, or the luck of it, but also the quantity, and the lack of it as well. Plenty of better options around, for the same price.Dear Np-In,Thank you for writing a review about your recent stay with us. We appreciate you mentioning the amenities that you did enjoy such as the queen bed, a/c unit and mini fridge. We genuinely apologize that your water temperature was not consistent and will pass on your issue to our maintenance department so we may investigate the problem. In regards to our free breakfast service, we take pride in our simple offering but only if it is the most superior quality. So again, we apologize that this failed to meet your expectations. We will use your feedback to better our services and hope that next time you visit New Orleans you will give us another chance to wow you.Warm Regards,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000
1776	2	The reviews were very good so we booked 2 rooms in this hotel for 3 nights. The reception staff was at best indifferent. We had booked a room with 2 double beds for our teenage children and they upgraded us to a king suite with a very uncomfortable pull out sofa. They did not try to accommodate us at all. The croissant in the morning was a bit stale. And the walls are paper thin, in each room we were woken up by people having sex next door almost every night...So apart from a good location and a decent price, I would not recommend this hotel. We did not enjoy our stay there....Dear Planetnat,Thank you for taking the time to review the St. James Hotel. I apologize for the mix up on your room upgrade and that our staff was unaccommodating. It is our goal to be your home away from home and unfortunately in this instance we failed. I understand how uncomfortable this must have been for your family and I do hope you give us another to chance to show you what our rooms have to offer! Sincerely
1777	5	I had chosen this hotel when booking bc it wasn't right in the French quarter but it was close enough you could walk to everything you would want to do within 10min. When we got there we were greeted by a lovely young lady named Ingrid. Let me tell you she was so helpful in getting us a room because we arrived early and showing us where to go and where not to go. Every one of her recommendations was a HUGE SUCCESS! She really is someone who takes pride in her job and she does her job very well. Honestly even if the hotel wasn't as nice as it was she made it worth it being there. You felt like you were going home to your house every night, the staff is soooo wonderful. Never had a better experience staying somewhere. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The old school feel was cool also. The restaurant next door called the Chop House was the best steak I have had in my life. Must try it I you stay at the hotel or love steaks! Dear Mark G, We are thrilled to read that you had a wonderful experience at the St. James Hotel. Thank you for taking the time to share the details of your stay and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit to our great city!We will be sure to share you kind words with Ingrid and the rest of our staff and are so glad that you enjoyed our location, rooms and restaurant. We hope you visit with us in the near future.Kind Regards,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000
1778	4	We had a great weekend getaway at the St. James Hotel. The location is convenient to Fulton Street and other warehouse district restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the quiet shaded courtyard between the buildings.Dear Cindy W, Thank you for your kind review. We are incredibly happy that you enjoyed your stay particularly the courtyard! Warmly, Jennifer Dragna General Manager (504)304-4000
1779	5	This place was wonderful. Staff was fantastic with all their help. Making reservations and with a handy umbrella when it rained. Great directions to sites to see. Just fantastic service which means a lot.
1780	5	Great location, near the Canal trolly, easy to get around, great staff! Absolutely love the breakfast delivery to the room! Now how can I get that at home. The coffee was was divine in the lobby at all times beautiful, clean, steaming hot coffee. Thank YOU!
1781	4	Stayed here for one night while on vacation. The rooms were small, I thought check in was confusing. There is valet parking for a fee. Very loud during the night with people's coming and going in the halls. Because of the noise probably wouldn't stay here again. Hotel was clean and staff was nice.Dear kirkpatricklThank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay at the St. James Hotel. We are a historic building that has been converted into the beautiful St. James hotel. Therefore, our rooms are all different sizes. We are in the process of soundproofing all of our rooms to solve any noise issues. We hope you decide to stay with us again next time you're in NOLA and please mention to the front desk clerk that you would prefer a larger room. Sincerely,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000
1782	5	Absolutely fantastic. Can't speak highly enough. Fantastic location and never once felt unsafe. You are far enough out of the main party places if you don't want to be involved, but close enough to walk if you want to involved.
1783	5	My family and I stayed for a night in New Orleans and decided to choose the St. James. We got a really great rate and didn't expect to get amazing service, but we were wrong. Amy checked us in and she was very informative and our children loved her! At check out, Danielle was so funny, sweet, and made sure we enjoyed everything about our stay. These two ladies embody that southern hospitality that we have always heard of. The hotel was very close to the aquarium and the French Quarter, which was great for a family of four! The next time we are in New Orleans, the St. James will be our number one choice! To Amy and Danielle, keep up the wonderful work!EmmC2,The St. James family was ecstatic to receive your review! We do our best to provide southern hospitality everyday and it is wonderful to hear we are getting it right! Amy, Danielle and the rest of our staff can't wait for your next visit to NOLA!Warm regards
1784	5	Staff was great. Very friendly. Hotel was clean, quiet, up to date. Very pretty. Close walking distance to everything French quarter, Jackson Square, Cafe du Monde, French Market, casino, riverboats, shopping, restaurants, streetcar.Dear Danielle K, Thank you for the great review! We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay and hope to see you again soon! Best, Jennifer Dragna General Manager (504)304-4000 jdragnanolahotelgroup.com
1785	4	The hotel is a 2 blocks outside the quarter, which we enjoyed - out of the fray. It is close to many nice restaurants and venues that we enjoy and is close enough to the quarter if you desire. The restaurant inside the hotel, The Chophouse, is very good known for their steaks. One feature I especially enjoyed, it was quiet!The hotel has a contract with a local garage service to valet park the cars for 30 over 24 hours. Two hours after our arrival, our car was still parked in front of the hotel. Upon departure, we discovered that all of the money (20) in our change drawer (there were bills included) had been taken. I called the manager on duty to notify of the problem. I was told this is not the first time this has happen. I am sure there are other garage services that would be happy to take on this contract.
1786	4	Attractive old hotel about 10 minute walk from the French quarter. Lovely internal courtyard. Staff very helpful booking river cruise etc. Room on the small side, quite comfortable BUT no windows. I suppose we could have asked to move but as we didn't spend much time in the room we didn't bother. Parking a bit pricey.
1787	5	Nice rooms, very helpful and welcoming staff. Great location, within walking distance of many great restaurants. Machiel took great care of us when we arrived. Very eager to answer any and all questions and point us in the right direction. Bell staff always brought a smile to our faces as they greeted us each morning with a kind word. Definitely recommend.
1788	5	The St James is a very good hotel , well priced and extremely well located for the French Quarter of New Orleans.Rooms are excellent.One item that could be a disadvantage for families with young children is the Continential Breakfast is served in your room .Very helpful and informative staff assisted me with tours and where to visit .Like most hotels near the French Quarter parking is a problem and in addition to there Valet parking there is a public car park right opposite the hotel.The Hotel was a pleasure to stay in.Dear cebkilifi,Thank you for the wonderful feedback regarding our cost, location, rooms, and staff. We appreciate your understanding of our valet parking service due to our fantastic location. I have passed along your comments about our breakfast service to our VP of Operations so that we may better service young families. It was a pleasure to service you! We hope to see you again soon!Warm Regards,Jennifer Dragna(504)304-4000
1789	5	We had booked a multi-centre holiday and needed to book at least one night in a hotel for the best airfare - so we decided that we would book this hotel as part of our overall package. It had been a long journey, London to New York then change planes for the trip to New Orleans. When we arrived we were both hot and tired and as there was no bar in the hotel we felt a bit let down. We were told there was a complimentary continental breakfast delivered to our room. We had no great expectation for that either.HOW WRONG CAN ONE BEAs it turned out, the breakfast was excellent. We have holidayed in France many times and the croissants were as good as any we have had in France. The orange juice was also excellent. They have an outside patio area and we were told we could order breakfast to be delivered there - which we did every subsequent day. A great start to the morning.The hotel is really well located for the French Quarter - an easy walk in the evening.The staff on reception were really helpful and friendly and offered a lot of help in terms of getting around and parking our car - when we had collected our hire car after a few days.I am sure there may be flashier and more expensive hotels in New Orleans, but if I were to return I would have no hesitation in returning to the St James Hotel.
1790	4	Check in was fairly smooth. All employees were very courteous Bed very comfortable. This was a convenient location for us. A short walk to trolley, French quarter and good restaurants. Right across the street was Bon Ton Cafe recommended to us by an employee. The food was great. I would definitely stay there againDear patpeder,Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay at the St. James Hotel. We are ecstatic that you felt very comfortable at our hotel because your comfort is of the utmost importance to our staff. We can't wait to welcome you back!Warm Regards,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000
1791	4	This hotel is in a good location. Even though it is considered to be in the Downtown area, it is within easy walking distance to Canal and Bourbon Streets. The rooms are very spacious. The breakfast was not as good as most of the Hampton Inns where we have stayed. Probably my only complaint is, we did not feel particularly safe after dark. The number of homeless and/or intoxicated people who line the streets in this area and leading up to the hotel made us feel quite uncomfortable. They are quite aggressive and demanding.We drove our vehicle and took advantage of valet parking. You do not need a vehicle in New Orleans. The trolley stops near the hotel. However, it was always packed. I suggest either walking or taking a cab to wherever you need to go. If traveling with kids who like to take advantage of a pool, there was not a pool.Thank you for your recent stay with us and taking time to give us a review! Happy to see you enjoyed your stay overall and apologize that you were not happy with the breakfast. I would love to get more feedback on the breakfast and see what we could have done better. I also apologize that the area made you uncomfortable at night. Our area is very safe and we usually do not have a homeless issue so I do apologize if there were some uncomfortable encounters with them. I do hope that you enjoyed New Orleans and again would love more feedback about the breakfast.Thanks!
1792	4	Great location and very friendly staff. We arrived early and was allowed to immediately check in. It is located in a very safe quiet street but you can get to the French Quarter in 3-5 minutes. (just 3 blocks) had a revcently renovated room. also breakfast was included. great deal.
1793	1	I recently stayed at the days inn in boardman Ohio. I understand it was a smoking room but when I got to my room it reeked of marijuana along with the tub being dirty and dozens of burn marks on the floor from cigarettes. Judging buy the hair that was in the bed I doubt that the sheets had been... More
1794	5	The hotel was cozy. The room was small but clean. Loved the pillows!!! It was a nice decent hotel for the price we got it for. They offered a free breakfast and the guy that checked us in was very friendly and was very kind. We will definitely stay again.
1795	4	I was there for couple days. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Comfortable stay. Cheap prices. The rooms were clean and neat. Good breakfast. Internet was little slow. But it got better later on.
1796	4	The stay was good. The only downfall was the hidden parking fee of 47 per night, which I was not made aware of until arrival.Thank you for your feedback. We understand that you have many choices, please keep us in mind in the future if your travels take you back to Santa Monica.

1804	1	I had stayed there before and gave them a positive review. However, when I went back, they had changed management. The staff is very negative, incompetent, and nasty. There is no shortage of drama. I went 4 weeks without any housekeeping and then the new manager blamed me. I am now staying in another place for now without any drama and my room is cleaned DAILY! Please don't put yourself through this - GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!
1805	5	We had a terrific stay, great accommodations, the owners are fantastic, friendly, helpful and the whole inn has a homey and friendly feel. It's also within walking distance of downtown Estes Park and just down the road from RMNP. We will absolutely stay here again.
1806	5	The Maxwell Inn is a wonderful, cozy retreat on the doorstep of Rocky Mountain National Park. The location is perfect! Rooms are really clean and have a rustic mountain lodge feel. The free breakfast is pretty solid, and there's a new patio outside where you can enjoy your morning coffee in the sun or a bonfire at night. The owners... More
1807	5	Our flight into Colorado was cancelled due to a blizzard event, shortening our stay at The Maxwell by one day. We called The Maxwell hoping to get some of our money back for the night we were going to miss. I was expecting to have to argue but Dana, one of the owners, completely understood and gave us a full... More
1808	1	I can't stay here again. Problem guest in the room upstairs from me and the security won't do a thing about it. Understandably, people will make noise in hotels, and it's something any hotel guest has to deal with. This is ridiculous, and if my only recourse is to point out how little the staff here cares about an unpleasant stay for guests, then I will do so in every available forum. Thanks for avoiding this place and not contributing to tolerance for disrespectful people. If it was just loud TV noise or whatever, I could deal, but this is constant running, stomping all evening long, and its not something I can tolerate.The Value Place team deeply apologizes for your negative experience during your stay with us. The issues you have mentioned will be addressed and handled. It is our mission to provide our guest with a positive experience, and in your case, we are deeply sorry that you were not pleased. We wish you the best.
1809	5	a friend and i stayed here and had a great time. the hotel room was nice, big and clean! we had nice accommodations and appreciated having a mini fridge as we were on a roadtrip trying to save money. just be careful as there are two rodeway inn's in san diego and we went to the wrong one first. would definitely stay again!Thank you for your review. My staff and I are happy to hear you had a great stay. There are several Rodeway Inns in San Diego and I'm glad we are on top of your list! We hope to see you back soon.Pratik Shah
1810	5	We arrived in the mid afternoon at the motel without resrvation. It was Saturday and that did not help the situation. Young lady at the reception desk told us that there was no vacancy for non-smoking room. We did not have a choice so we took a smoking room. What a surprise. The room did not smell at all.
1811	4	We had an awesome stay at this motel. The rooms were just fine, nice looking and clean. I liked the granite surfaces very much, as well as the beautiful tub enclosures. Everything worked fine. The staff was very cordial and cheerful, and when I called to make reservations, Hina was very nice and extremely helpful. The maintenance man was very nice and always had a wonderful smile. The housekeepers and he all seemed to get along very well, we could hear them laughing and enjoying each other's company. The office staff were great also.The only thing that was a bit annoying was that the showers have to run at a fast speed to get any water, and really fast to get warm water. The flow couldn't be adjusted. That was the only thing that bothers us. The towels were nice and soft and clean, the beds were always fresh and clean, the whole area was very pretty. There are hills and canyons all around and there was even a creek behind it and lots of trees. There was never a problem getting a parking spot even if we came back late. It's close to the trolley station, but not a comfortable walk. We drove to it and parked. We did that in order to walk around downtown and by the bay. I would recommend this motel to anyone who wants a quiet, nice and friendly motel. It's also very close to a beautiful Catholic Church, St. Therese, which is at 6016 Camino Rico. Thank you for your review. My staff and I are happy to see you enjoyed your stay. They are very high spirited and bring a lot of their personality to the overall experience of the hotel. Even with all your positive comments, I would still like to work on areas that did not meet your expectations. I will look into how we can adjust the water pressure or shower heads to provide a more comfortable stay for our guests. Thanks again for choosing us and we hope to see you again soon!
1812	5	First the people were very friendly and helpful! The breakfast was good, would of been nice to have some eggs and a meat but you get to make your own waffles, they have fresh fruit, milk, juice, cereal, bagels among other things so by far better than a regular old continental breakfast! The room was great, could not have been any cleaner if we were the first persons to stay there and the fact that it was recently remodeled shows. We were there for my sons Marine graduation and his Uncle stayed at a more expensive hotel by the bay and had to change rooms 3 times then ended up changing hotels all together and still didn't get one with a working A/C. He got no fridge or microwave with his room either, that was an extra cost, my room came with both at no extra cost along with a coffee pot, hair drier and iron. The new A/C in this room kept it really cold in the room just like we like it. The bathtub was so clean with the new tile and tub it didn't even have a water stain anywhere. Had 2 queen beds that are almost as comfortable as my double pillow top at home! Nice soft fluffy pillows! The only bad thing we could say about our whole 4 day stay there was the pool is very small, but worse than that is the fact that it is either not heated or they had not turned it on yet, so the water was too chilly to swim. But I can live with that for the extra comfort of the stay. Also the interstate was not too far from my room but I heard nothing over the steady hum of my A/C. The free WiFi worked good, not real fast but reliable, and the parking lot was a tight fit the free parking was a added bonus considering some hotels in San Diego charge up to 38 a night to park in their lot! Would stay there again any time! Thanks for making our stay so comfortable!!!
1813	1	This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. As a loyal platinum member I was hoping the general manager Anonio Demarco would be able to assist my husband and I with a huge dilemma we encountered, which was our camera (SLR) , stolen inside their lobby while we were checking out.we were instructed to file a police report and were somewhat assured to have access to the security tapes to find the culprit. Antonio was inconsiderate, rude, and simply lacked empathetic skills while speaking to us. He told he will not show us because he does not have to, blamed us for our item being stolen. never stay here! They have zero security outside and inside, lobbies are empty anyone can walk in and out and steal your luggage. Poorly designed rooms, thin walls, you can hear your neighbors literally whispering. Hot water was not even hot. Poor hotel and poor management. Extremely dissatisfied and regret booking.
1814	2	We had high hopes for this place and were sorely disappointed. The bathrooms are TINY which is ridiculous as there are two closets so why when the did the rehab didn't they widen the bathroom into the closet The shower is 2 feet wide and you need to stand at an angle to the sink to use it because there is no room. The toilet is wedged between the sink and shower.There is only a desk chair, no comfortable seating in the room. I had a decent street view but the window was painted shut.Despite being in the Tenderloin I like the location, easy access for the Ubers and far less touristy than Union Square, there is a great breakfast place across the street called Farm:Table. But all in all I would suggest a full service Marriott nearby for an extra 20Frederico1st - We will like to sincerely apologize about the inconvenience you faced during your recent visit and we are also disappointed that you did not enjoy your stay. We will certain address your concerns with our ownership. Thank you for staying with us.
1815	5	This Courtyard is great location whether you're in town for business or leisure. At the adjacent parking lot, they have drop boxes for FedEx, UPS, and Ontrac. This hotel is also about 15 minutes away from San Diego Safari Park. Great view of the duck pond on the back of the hotel. It also within walking distance to a very good Chinese restaurant.Dear NagaandKambing,I am glad to hear you have enjoyed our location. Please let the front desk know during your future stay and we would love to recommend local wineries and restaurants near us. Sincerely,Francesca Suh
1816	4	Very nice hotel. As you would expect the rooms are standard size, clean and comfortable. The breakfast area is good size but gets busy in the morning, so leave a little extra time. The pool and patio area are well kept and overlook a nice pond/garden area. There are lots of restaurants within walking distance. Staff was friendly and helpful.
1817	4	We have family in Rancho Bernardo and often stay here and most recently stayed a few nights after Christmas. It's in a good location, next to a freeway, though am happy to report we never hear the freeway much. They have a Cafe which is great but they don't have a real Starbucks but it's better than nothing. Will stay here again.
1818	5	Reward points stay for a weekend getaway for me and my wife. We usually stay at the Gaslamp Marriott, but we were looking for a change of scenery. A little confusing with the Springhill and Residence Inn being in the same building, but, nothing to difficult to figure out. Check in was a breeze, and Vanessa was extremely helpful and friendly. As a Platinum premier member I was offered the standard choice of a market item or points. I chose points as I always do. About 1/2 hour after check in a bottle of wine and 2 glasses showed up at my room compliments of Vanessa. What a great surprise! Rooms were clean and modern, if not a little small from an older Springhill suites. The only issue we really had was with the breakfast buffet. I know it is complimentary, but, the eggs and sausage were pretty much inedible. Other then that, I would recommend this location anyone looking for a hotel in a great location between the water front and Little Italy.
1819	4	This hotel was very new and modern. Very clean. Staff friendly. It was clean and is located near the airport. We had a nice water view. There was no shuttle or room service. The counter space in the bathroom is a bit small. But the room had a couch and coffee table in addition the the bed area. That was a plus. We called Uber and got to the airport for 8.50. Not too bad. Would stay again. Cozy pillows and mattress.
1820	4	I know, I know, it's San Diego, and we bit the bullet and coughed up the 45 daily parking fees, but it was such a hassle that while we were there we used Uber for our in-and-out short trips. Hotel itself was nice and bright and clean. Friendly and helpful staff. We had a corner room with bay view, which was nice. Thought it strange though that there was a huge exposed grey concrete support in the corner of the room. Breakfast buffet was plentiful but would have liked a bacon offering also.
1821	4	This is a perfect location for business, located next to freeway makes access easy for traveling around Seattle area. It can be a bit noisy also because it's located next to freeway. The suite is spacious and comfortable. The staff is friendly and the bar/restaurant area is convenient. You can't beat the free breakfast and every floor has snacks located near the elevators if you want something quick. I would definitely stay there again.Glad you got to take advantage of everything here, Lisa! From the rooms to the snacks and breakfast, you deserve the best from our team, and we'd all love to see you back here next time you're in town! Best, Frank F., General Manager
1822	2	I stayed at this hotel for 3 days. I needed a taxi twice and both times I gave the front desk staff ample notice about needing a taxi but they could not get a taxi to arrive on time or arrive at all. In one instance when the taxi did not show up I almost missed a ferry on which I was scheduled and I would have had to wait a day for the next ferry.One of the hotel managers said they had 'problems' getting taxi's to come to the hotel. Unfortunately, the hotel did not share that with me until it was too late. Otherwise I would have handled my transportation needs myself and not rely on the hotel.My suggestion is not to rely on the hotel for transportation, make your own arrangements.Hello James D.! Please accept my apology for the spotty taxi service. We do, at times, struggle to get cabs to our hotel during peak times. We should have done a better job in communicating with you and offered other options. I really do appreciate your feedback and hope to see you again.
1823	3	Hotel was average, the rooms are large as a suite should be, King bed and separate area with sofa bed, desk and bench that included a fridge, microwave and sink. Rooms clean but bath room a bit small for size of room but Ok. Hotel is almost on the I5 interstate so there was a road hum/noise all night and the AC reminded me of being on the plane. Some would not like the noise, The breakfast room was woefully inadequate to hold guests compounded by the fact that guests would not clean up after them. Hotel out of the center of city but did run a shuttle to the down town and space needle on the hour. Does have a guest laundry.Good Day Rowan T,Thank you for the review. We are glad you enjoyed your stay.Regards,
1824	4	I am a consultant who is away from home nearly every Monday through Thursday. The accomodations at the SpringHill Suites have been very satisfactory and the staff has been excellent! It is nice for folks that know you are away from home to greet you in a very friendly manner, go out of their way to make you feel at home and truly care about your comfort. As I move on to the next project, I will truly miss the SpringHill, especially their staff!
1825	4	Room: 9th floor, executive suite (). large, clean, had a sink, mini fridge and a microwave, a small living area.Amenities: pool and a hot tub, open till 12 PM. Free breakfast downstairs, but they also set out some pastries, fruit, cereal and coffee on my floor by the elevator. I'm not sure if that appies to all floors or just the top few.Free tea/ coffee downstairs 24 hLocation: an easy 10 min walk to the WSCC.Gym: small, but there's a 24-h Fitness right across the street, and they offer a special daily rate to hotel guests. Canadian GoodLife members - we get free access to ALL 24 Hour Fitness locations in the US, it's a mutual partnership these gyms have. Just show your keytag and sign the guest log.Thank you very much for writing us, Maria -- I'm glad you enjoyed your stay. It's great to hear everything from our amenities to our breakfast set up to our location added value to your trip. We're looking forward to your return! - Frank F., General Manager
1826	5	This is a really great place to stay when visiting Seattle. Not only are the front desk staff friendly, welcoming, and helpful, they are personally delightful. The full breakfast provided is absolutely delicious with many, many freshly made items to choose from, and the area is kept spotless. When staying on floors 10 and above, morning and evening snacks and lots of cold bottled water are available in the hallways.I'm thrilled you had such an amazing stay with us, Sue. We're always here to make it a perfect one, and I'm looking forward to seeing you back here next time you're in town! Until then, Frank F., General Manager
1827	2	I'm a Marriott Platinum Elite member. I stay at Marriott hotels 100+ nights each year. I gave this hotel a try in May of 2016. It's a nice, modern hotel in a good location, with all the amenities typically found at a Springhill Suites.However.....the Air Conditioning unit couldn't cool the room. I ran it all night and it never succeeded in getting the room temp below 70 degrees.Hotels MUST allow their guests to keep the room at the temperature they desire. This means installing AC units that are powerful enough to cool the rooms to the desired temp.This Marriott failed in that regard, and thus I cannot recommend, nor do I plan to return.This is so disappointing to see, and I'm so sorry that your room wasn't up to par. My team and I would have been more than happy to fix it in the moment, but I appreciate the feedback nonetheless. I hope you can give us another shot to show you the stay you deserve. Best, Frank F., General Manager
1828	5	I loved my stay at the Springhill Suites in Seattle. I was in town from Fort Mohave, Arizona, visiting a friend. We stayed here, because it was basically in the middle of everything we were doing in 2 days. The staff was super friendly, the room was perfect, breakfast in the morning was great, and the shuttle service to the Space Needle was a nice plus. We got checked in by 11 am, which was great, because we had a day full of activities planned, and it was nice to get our stuff put away so we could enjoy ourselves. The price was very reasonable as well. I totally recommend staying here!!
1829	4	We stayed for about a week. Beds were plush and very comfortable. Ours had a king sofa bed. A nice counter sized fridge is included, and the room had an extra sink. Suites are a large room with a short (4 ft) divider. There were lots of AC outlets including on lamps on the desk and 2 near the bed . Internet speed was excellent, averaging 5Mb/sec. Pricing is lower if you stay 5 days.The hotel has a small pool and exercise room. 24hr fitness, with lots of machines and weights is across the street and free to guests. Staff is happy, friendly and helpful.Breakfast was surprisingly good. Eggs were real, with cereal, fresh fruit, oatmeal, yogurt and pastries. Coffee and Tea (Bigelow bags) are served 24/7. Best of all, the hot water didn't taste like coffee! Dinner was just OK. There are better choices in the area.Location: Off I-5, but takes 10-15 min (in rush hr) due to one-way streets/traffic. Immediate exit onto I-5. It is a 12 min walk from the Airport train. It is not downtown, but it's close (15-20 min). The Space needle and museum complex is about a 15 min walk. The neighborhood to the northwest is full of newly constructed apartments, plus many cafes and upscale restaurants. There is a whole foods (7 min walk) with a huge deli/bakery/salad bar if you want something cheap easy, but no nearby convenience store. (Don't miss Market House on Howell for corned beef!) Walk east across I-5 (up Denny Olive)) and you'll find funkier neighborhoods and parks, plus cheaper (and excellent) eateries. There are many homeless people and panhandlers in the area west of the hotel. The Pikes Market/waterfront is 15-20 min on foot. A giant REI is a block away and worth visiting. It's also the non-hotel food in the evening.Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a detailed review -- these kinds of tips are always helpful for our newer guests. It sounds like you were able to see a lot of the city while you were in town. Hope you'll consider us for your next trip to Seattle!All the best,Frank F., General Manager
1830	4	okay, let's first establish that in the downtown Seattle area, prices are very high, and they charge and 'arm and a leg' for onsite parking...that is simply the way it is. and traffic in the immediate area is very congested.but this hotel is very nice, the rooms are spacious, clean and newly renovated, and the staff is friendly. what is more, the free breakfast is the best I have come across at any Spring Hill Suites anywhere in the country...the breakfast is better than the majority of Marriott concierge's lounges. we have previously stayed at the Courtyard on Lake Union...the Spring Hill Suites is a much better value, and a nicer overall property.We're happy you enjoyed the rooms and friendly service, Bill! You can always count on us for comfortable accommodations and tasty breakfast. We hope to welcome you back in the future. Thanks, Frank F., General Manager
1831	4	Very nice hotel. Clean, well appointed room. Great shuttle service. We stayed 2 nights before a cruise and were very happy here. My only complaint is that there was not enough seating for breakfast. But breakfast was good and there were plenty of food options. Would gladly stay here again.
1832	5	We stayed one night and used the shuttle to get around! The front desk was helpful and nice! We needed a cell phone charger and they let us use one. We had breakfast it was free and good! I would stay there again. Room was clean and a good space for two of us. Bed was very good! I think the do not use fire sprinkler heads as a hanger holder was funny but I am guessing someone has done it!
1833	4	We lucked out with a groupon which included a bottle of wine each night and 25 dollars a day to spend at their restaurant. It was so inexpensive. The staff are very warm and friendly. Rooms are ok. I would give it higher rating if they could update the mattress. We enjoyed ourselves.
1834	3	Good rate/price for Lake Union - Seattle. Right now, it is hard to reach this hotel due to the street construction. But, we finally made it. Got into our room early which was nice. The rooms are a little dated,,,but were clean. Front desk folks were very good and treated us nice. Gave us a room overlooking the lake. Funny thing,,,I wanted to comment on the bed being too soft,,so on the day we departed, I noticed a new mattress ready to be installed in our room sitting outside the door!!! Breakfast was adequate to good. I do not know, but hotels with free breakfast just don't cook good scrambled eggs!! :( Good coffee though, after all, this is Seattle!!Overall,,this Marriott hotel needs some renovation,,,but pretty good place to stay,,,I would stay again.
1835	5	Great location for quick access to downtown transportation. Close to the Space Needle, PSC, Chihuly Glass Museum. Good breakfast! Nice to have a suite with children. Also nice to have 2 rooms to spread out.Dear BSjhwolfe, Thank you so much for staying with us. I am glad that the larger room and convenient location worked well for you and your family. We hope to see you again the next time you visit Seattle! Sincerely, Ryan N General Manager
1836	3	the rooms were clean and comfortable and we were lucky to have view of the water. The rooms had everything we needed, wifi was the best anywhere we have stayed around the world and the staff were very helpful .i thought it was a European thing having dogs in hotels and resturants....really didn't like sharing my meal with everyone's pets.Thank you for the great review. I love to hear that our internet is the best in the world! I am sorry that you were surprised by the pets in the lobby. Residence Inns are all Pet Friendly hotels and we do a special deep clean in those rooms that have hosted animals.
1837	5	12/24/12 This property is top-notch. Crisp, clean, staff outstanding. Pool area, laundry, exercise facilities. Rooms well appointed. All mattresses have now been replaced as of this week. Bid for the room on Priceline for 70.00. Well worth it. I was really impressed. Desk staff perfect. Teas and coffee in the lobby at all hours. Breakfast bar well stocked. Eggs, potatoes, condiments, assortment of pastries. Parking is 20.00. But, if you arrive after 6p, you can park along the street, as long as you plan on moving by 8am. Or, if on Sundays or Holidays, no charge for street parking. Construction going on on the streets, but not a big deal. Streetcar right in front of property to take you a few blocks into town. LOVE LOVE LOVE this property! Thank you guys. As a former Marriott manager, I can tell you that you got it right. Cudos!
1838	3	The staff at the front desk was not friendly nor were the people at breakfast. The only person who was friendly was the house keeping lady who I pointed out the water leaking into our bathroom from the room above us. The ceiling was being damaged and was damp. I wanted to make sure somebody knew about it because the folks at the front desk didn't seem to care.Thank you for your honest feedback regarding your stay. I am certainly disappointed in our team for leaving you with an impression of the hotel that is anything less than outstanding. If there is any specific information you can recall about your stay I would love to hear more so we can resolve the issue moving forward for our future guests. Please feel free to contact me directly at the hotel.
1839	4	Very friendly staff at this facility. From housekeeping to front desk everyone is very helpful and nice. Management is doing a good job!The room is very comfortable, well furnished and the amenities are very good. Housekeeping is very attentive and accommodating when requests are left for them.The breakfast buffet is good considering it is included. The light dinner / snack is less attractive, but it is free if you need a quick bite to each in a pinch.The lobby area is comfortable for quick meetings. The lounge area with a fireplace and large TV is good for relaxing if you don't want to be in your room by yourself.The pool, sauna, hot tub and workout room are well maintained and equipped.I'll be staying here next time I'm in Seattle.
1840	5	This Residence Inn, like a few others I have used in the past, is due for a decorating update. BUT if you can look past the dated decor, this place is a GEM.The room was fine with an outside balcony overlooking the lake, a full kitchen, and bedroom with bath. And housekeeping always left us extra coffee packets as requested, maybe because I always left them a 2 bill as a tip.Breakfast was ample and well attended by staff. And front desk were always informative and helpful.The LOCATION was the perfect and allowed access to downtown and I-5 by car or public transportation.Thank you for sharing your feedback. Are your comments about the dcor directed more towards the rooms, or the lobby area Or both Have a great day!
1841	5	We stayed here as a family. It's expensive but the accommodations are first class. We had a two bedroom suite with a mini kitchen. The location met our needs to a T. There are restaurants, grocery stores and attractions within walking distsnce. It has has an exercise room, a coffee bar and taproom on premise. Public transportation is right outside the front door. My only complaint, ie-dissapointment, was what I thought was an outrageous charge of 30 per day for using the parking garage. To me this was an exorbitant fee for an already expensive hotel stay. Otherwise I was more than completely satisfied. Thank you for your fantastic feedback. We look forward to welcoming you back to Lake Union someday!
1842	5	We just got back from a Princess Cruise to Alaska and stayed at the Residence Inn Pre-Cruise and loved the staff and hotel, we stayed again post cruise. We had a two bedroom two bathroom suite my wife and I shared with her two sisters. The rooms were seperated by a Kitchen and living room area. The hotel was extremely clean and the staff was exceptional. We had never been to Seattle before and Mary, Susanne and Eric were always there to help us with our sightseeing questions and needs. The fist day we walked to the space needle and then took the monorail to downtown Seattle and Pike's Market. We then took the streetcar back to the hotel. We had a reservation at another hotel post cruise, but cancelled it and went back to the Residence Inn. They have a great breakfast in the morning, free Wi-fi in the rooms, and it is right out the door from Lake Union, great restaurants and the marina. The hotel rates were reasonable and we just can't say enough about the city, hotel and the staff. We'll be back!
1843	5	My family and I stayed at this hotel for our niece's wedding in Seattle.The hotel is great.They serve a very nice buffet breakfast everymorning.The rooms are clean and have a mini kitchen with everything you may need if youwanted to cook a meal. dishwasher, microwave etcAcross the street are many great restuarants...one is Duke's Chowder housewith a nice view of the marina. The food is fantastic.Another great restaurant was Bluwater Bistro. Excellent food.The hotel has a town car that can transfer you to the airport for 35 or 40 dollars instead'of taking a cab. by the way Seattle has one of the best TSA screenings for aiport security I was impress..... They are the best.The hotel is only a 15 minute walk to the space needle. You can take the trolleyfor two dollars if you dont want to walk which is only a one block walk.The internet is free and if you just want to print your flight boarding pass... thefront desk has a computer for just printing boarding passes.It's a great hotel that is close to everything.
1844	5	Stayed on the second floor in a king suite. The rooms/lobby feel a little bit dated, but the location and amenities make up for it!Princess greeted me when I checked in (with mobile check in) and was absolutely phenomenal. We had requested a room with 2 queen size beds, but they were booked up, so we made due with the pull out sofa.So nice being pet friendly, we had our companion animal with us and he was comfortable as were we!Nice pool/hot tub area. Parking spots were tight, but manageable. Breakfast was well stocked and very top notch. Some dust on the fake flower arrangements near the buffet, which would be my only complaint about breakfast. Tortillas to make breakfast burritos, standard eggs/meat/cereal/waffles/yogurt/bread station, etc. (no potatoes, which was surprising)The pizza restaurant was great as well. They told us about 2 hour wait, but felt like only 30/45 minutes, and they were good size pizzas, not what I was expecting!Overall, 10/10 stay. Would definitely stay here again!
1845	4	Stayed here with my family over Spring Break in a 2-bedroom suite. Great location, right on the Street Car Line with easy access to downtown and Space Needle. Staff was very pleasant, and hotel was clean and beds were comfy. Breakfast was ok - free and ample, but not the tastiest. Worst thing about the hotel (and it's not really that bad) was the coffee.
1846	4	This was a clean friendly hotel with amenities which were nice. Very convenient to three wonderful restaurants - walking distance across the street. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay there again when in Seattle, WA
1847	5	The Staff here is great(Christopher, Faith, John, Sheneke Jessica) ! everyone is so helpful and nice. Sheneke made me some cookies and I have become the biggest Fairfield Fan. The location is great. We were able to get to any place easily. Sheneke told us where we could find the best cheese steak is Philly. We could not be any more happy with our stay here. when i first called Chris at the front desk got our info and had us booked in our room in about 5 minutes.Hi!Thank you so much for your feedback. We LOVE positive reviews and continuously celebrate success. Chris, Faith, John, Sheneke and Jessica were all in smiles when I shared your feedback with them along with the rest of the team. Especially Sheneke! She is very happy. We would love for you to come back and see us again in the future.Yours in hospitality,Paulette M.
1848	5	Long week of traveling and stayed here last night of trip! Tamika made my week! Extremely helpful and a joy to be around! The room was nice and clean. The staff was extremely helpful and kind.Thanks Tamika!Thank you for taking the time to complete our Trip Advisor survey. We are delighted that your stay with the Fairfield Inn Philadelphia Airport was enjoyable. Everything we do is aimed at providing you with an excellent hotel experience and your feedback is extremely valuable. We tuly appreciate you sharing your thoughts with us so that we may continue to deliver exceptional service in the future.Yours In Hospitality,Faith Jones
1849	5	Due to bad weather my flight was changed and had an unplanned stay in Philly. I got in late at night. Waited for the shuttle to the hotel. After a little wait and no shuttle I called the hotel. Found out you had to call ( I didn't know that) and in five minutes the shuttle was there. Could not believe how fast it got there. Bruce, the driver could not have been nicer. Jessica at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. Very nice place and one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed in. Had an early flight in the morning so I was too early for breakfast. She was just setting up but offered to get me a bagel. Everyone was very friendly. If I ever have to stay over in Philly again I would definitely stay there!!!!Thank you for choosing the Fairfield Inn/Marriott. We are delighted that you had a pleasant stay with us. I will be sure to inform my team that they had a impact on your stay. Should you require any further assistance please feel free to contact the hotel.Thank you Faith JonesAssistant General Manager
1850	5	The Philly Airport Fairfield was most convenient location for our business here but out of the way if you're looking for a neighborhood type hotel. The shuttle will take you to the airport where you can get septa (public transportation) to go downtown or any point you want. John was a really friendly driver and the vans even have complimentary bottled water. The hotel itself is typical Fairfield but has recently been updated to the newest color combos. Breakfast is super which definitely makes Fairfield an outstanding value. There is a Ruby Tuesday right across the street for a quick dinner without getting back in the car. We've yet to have a bad experience with Marriott which is why they remain our preferred brand.Hello,Thank you for your feedback. We would love for you to come back and stay with us when you return. Feel free to give me a call so that I may be able to personally assist you with your accomodations.Yours in hospitality,Paulette M.
1851	5	I can't even begin to explain how blown away by the Management and staff of this hotel is. I was stuck here due to the big snow storm that shut down the city. I had some small issues, credit card, Hertz, FREEZING COLD...LOL The whole time, while checking in and the little request, that all travelers will have from time to time, Christopher and Tamika were joys at the desk and always kept a smile, even as customer after customer came in and tried to book (no vacancies) and were turned away or had to wait in the line to check in. Bruce drove to me to my, around the corner, destination, without batting an eye, even in this crazy weather. Faith has been here the whole time, making sure rooms are ready, and that customers and her staff are happy and in good spirits, under the circumstances. I had to switch rooms and was a little ahead of the move, when I notified Sidah, who was making sure my new room was clean and in order. She offered to help me gather my belongings, and move them to my new room. I know, from experience, that most employees, at hotels, don't even offer to hold the door in that situation and here she was offering to help relocate me. I had an issue with my T.V. (in my new room) and Ruben came up and fixed it, by getting me one that had been programmed, with out me waiting forever and a day, without huffing or grimacing. He was a delight to talk to.I can tell that Paulette manages, not only a wonderful crew, but she does it with such compassion and caring, that it resonates to the customers. I will be telling all of my friends, clients, coworkers and anyone else that I can, to stay at this hotel, when they pass through the Philly area!Hi Ms. C!Thank you so much! We are dedicated to providing outstanding service. I am glad that we could accomodate you during that particular storm. Your kind words mean alot to us. I have shared your comments with the team and everyone remembers you! We made it a fun filled, stress-free evening for all of our stranded guest. Thank you for being such a great guest. Please come back and see us again when you are in the Philadelphia area!Yours in hospitality,Paulette M.
1852	3	Having flown in from Australia en route to Quebec I had a stop over in Philadelphia. Looking forward to a nice quiet room and a break from the 20+ hours of travel it took to get to Philadelphia I checked in at the Fairfield. The free shuttle arrived as promised and the driver was friendly. Reception was pleasant but distant , the room was clean. I had forgotten to pack a power adapter and upon checking with reception and eventually translating the word adapter into a version of the word the receptionist could understand I was told they didn't have them only power point to USB adapters . Which was great for my phone. It was annoying to not be able to get an adapter from reception but even more annoying was the nonchalant attitude of the staff. Not in any way rude just uncaring . The free breakfast was welcome and filling . All in all the place was nothing more and nothing less than a 3 star hotel . Would I go there again If I had to , yes but I'd look elsewhere first Thank you for your feedback. I would like to apologize on behalf of our staff and assure you that your feedback will help us create a better tomorrow for our guest. I will your share your comments with the staff.
1853	4	The hotel is in a quiet area although it is not far from the airport. I wanted to return my rental the night before so they helped me figure it out to get back to the hotel. The staff has been great since check in helping with places to eat and checking in early. Thank you for making us your choice hotel while staying in the Philadelphia area. We are so delighted that we were able to enusre that you had a wonderful stay. We hope that you will come and visit us again. If you should have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact the hotel.Thank you,Faith JonesAssistant General ManagerMaking Everlasting Impressions
1854	3	We stayed here for one night before our friends' wedding weekend because the wedding hotel was not available that night.Our room was on the first floor and had a damp, musty feeling to it. The room was clean though and the air conditioning worked. Good water pressure in the shower, but no conditioner or body wash provided. The pool was nice but a bit cold. The airport shuttle was convenient.The breakfast was a standard continental breakfast and is included. Overall it was an adequate stay at a reasonable price. Nothing special but nothing overly bad either.I would like to thank you for your business as we appreciate it very much. I would like to offer my apologies as we were unable to exceed your expectations. We will be sure to share review your feedback as a team and will work to improve. Thank you.
1855	5	I love to stay here the people are the best They help with anything we need .Also I stay at the Fairfield inn in Exton PA. and I know they own by the same people and staff are the best at both places . We always stay here after we stay in Exton so we have the airport Shuttle the next morning. The remodel looks great and the new beds are greatHello!Thank you so much for taking the time to provide your feedback! We are extremely excited about our newly renovated rooms. They look absolutely amazing and we are recieving excellent reviews! Thank you for making us your choice hotel while staying in the Philadelphia area. We would love for you to come and stay with us again in the future.Yours in hospitality,Paulette M.GM
1856	5	Clean beautiful room! smelled freshly painted! Tastefully decorated! great attendants! we arrived at night cuz we couldn't fly on our scheduled flight, they gave us free drinks and even a free shuttle ride to 'shop rite' cuz we needed baby formula! Affordable and definitely a go to! Thank you again!
1857	4	My son and I recently went to a concert at the Wells Fargo Center and were flying out of PHL early the next morning. I booked a room at the Fairfield Inn and I'm glad I did. The price was reasonable, the room was clean and comfortable and the staff were all friendly and helpful. The sports complex is easily accessible. I will definitely stay here again. I highly recommend it, whether you want a hotel close to the airport or the sports complex.Hello,Thank you so much for taking the time to provide your feedback! We look forward to seeing you again! Please feel free to reach out to me if you require assistance booking your future accomodations.Yours in hospitality,Paulette M.
1858	3	I've stayed at other Fairfield Inns and my overall experience has been good. If you're looking for a very basic, nice hotel, this is a good one. But, there are a few caveats. The room was cold, and the bedding is extremely minimal - just a sheet and a very light cover. Upon requesting a couple of extra blankets, I was told that they weren't sure they had any. Luckily, a nice gentleman showed up at the door with blankets a few minutes later. Although the sign in the bathroom says that if you hang up your towels you can help the hotel to be green by not washing and replacing them every day, this wasn't the case. Each and every day, there were new towels. Also, the toiletries were never replenished, so I had to request more. On the last night of my stay, I discovered a silverfish and an ant on the bathroom floor. This might suggest that the hotel do a little more cleaning to prevent this type of incident in the future.I used the hotel's shuttle to go to the airport Marriott location for dinner one night. This was a very convenient option, and the driver was very nice and accommodating.The breakfast was great (breakfast sandwiches, waffles, fruit, oatmeal, etc,) and service was extremely friendly!Hello,Thank you very much for taking the time to provide your feedback. I will be sure to look into the items that you have mentioned. We value you and would love another opportunity to serve you in the future! If, you are ever in the Philadelphia area again please feel free to reach out to me so that I may be able to personally assist you.Yours in hospitality,Paulette Moore
1859	5	Our family stays here often when visiting Philadelphia. The staff members go out of their way to help with anything, always good advice on local events and getting around. Having the Ruby Tuesday's across the street is convenient and the train station is a 10 minute walk or hotel shuttle will take you as well. Thank you for taking the time out of your to share your feedback with us. I will be sure to relay your kind words regarding the team going above and beyond. We strive for excellence and it is so nice to hear that we were able to not just meet, but exceed your expectations. Thank you once gain for your business. Pleas return to us soon!
1860	5	Just a quick review here :Room was very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Large LCD TV with good variety of channel. In room coffee maker.Breakfast was good. Sausage, scrambled egg, cereals, fruits, and assorted muffin, bagel, bread.What I like the most is the strong water preassure in the shower. Excellent.Thank you for making the Fairfield Inn/Marriott your choice hotel. We excited that you were very satisfied with your stay. I will ensure that I share your comments with my team who will be more than happy to know that they made your stay an exceptional one. Should you require any further assistance please feel free to contact the hotel.Thank youFaith JonesAssistant General Manager
1861	5	ed here more than once and when I arrived I am always acknowledged by my name. From the time I was greeted at the font desk by jovial, sweet and friendly Monique I am always glad to get to my room after a long trip where being a Hilton Honors member really pays. Michael is wonderful. I swear he can do 8 things at once! He has helped me with the computer at late hours when I couldn't figure out how to print/fax, etc.My most recent stay I lost my Samsung Fit. I didn't know if I lost it in the hall, or where. I looked everywhere and housekeeping helped me also. They know my phone number and I let them know that I lost it last week. I received a phone call from Michael that Shaunta found it and they actually have an HONEST staff that called and e mailed me to let me know. What a refreshing experience. Shaunte found it and Karen (who is awesome) wanted to know where to mail it to since they know I travel the world. Monique,Shaunte and Karen and Michael and I know I am missing a lot of the rest of the staffs names. I have NEVER had a bad experience and can't thank them enough. The first time I stayed there they overachieved my expectations. Karen went the extra mile with faxing a 23 page fax that only had 22 pages go through. She re sent it and I had a flight to catch. When I landed she had left me a voice mail that it had went through. Who does that!!!I will NEVER stay anywhere else in Philly since I found them. They are the best!
1862	5	We book our room around December of 2012 . We arrived on Wednesday June 12th 2013. as we got out of our car the hotel staff that was present greeted us . the front desk staff got our info and had us booked in our room in about 10 mimutes.Was very friendly . I would say that the room was really more like a suite than a double room. the breakfast was very good. all in all the five days we stayed was better that some more high price other hotels. And it was located just five minutes from our kids home, with a wawa just down from it.GoodMorning,Thank you so much for taking the time to provide your feedback. We are honored that we could share this joyous occasion with you. We would love for you to come back and see us again in the future!Yours in hospitality,Paulette M.
1863	3	At first glance this is the Marriott of choice if you're looking for the free breakfast, free wireless, fitness center and comfortable rooms that are standard Marriott fare. With free airport shuttle service I picked this over the Courtyard by Marriott at PHL because of the free hot breakfast here instead of the 12 charge at the Courtyard.I stayed because I had an early flight out in the morning and living just over an hour away didn't want to risk any delays especially with a weekday traffic coming into Philadelphia from New Jersey.So why did I feel cheated I had stayed before at the Courtyard because on that date they had a much better rate and their fly and park rate is 10 a day.The Fairfield Inn offers free parking the night of your stay. I would be returning three days later but they insisted on a 60 parking charge because they only sell parking on a weekly basis there was no prorated offer for the three days I needed.I discovered this as I was checking out so instead of a quick free shuttle to my terminal I had to go to a nearby parking lot to get a better rate and rush to make my flight.If you'll be away for six or seven days it's ok but for three the charge was excessive. I am a Platinum Elite Marriott Rewards member and I can honestly say this was the first time I experienced a policy that didn't have any consideration for the guest's experience.I would like to offer my most sincere apologies for the frustrations you were faced with regarding the park and fly program. All the properties in the area do have their own policies for parking. We do offer complimentary parking for the time that you are staying with us. If you choose to leave your vehicle with us traveling, we do have a fee that is charged. Unfortunately, our hands are tied as far as being able to waive this fee. I once again apologize for this. We do appreciate your business, status, and loyalty with Marriott. If you would like to discuss this further, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly.

1865	3	Stayed overnight for an early flight. Hotel room needs a facelift. The breakfast was nice, staff was very friendly, efficient shuttle. Charges an additional 60 to leave the car for a week--which is quite pricey. We are platinum level and only stay in Marriott hotel family hotel when possible, but this one needs fluffing.
1866	4	We stayed overnight during the Thanksgiving break as one of us had to fly out the next morning by the 7am flight. They had a very convenient shuttle which dropped him off. The family got up later and went down for breakfast. It was almost 10 which is when they close. All the ladies who were there, kept the breakfast area open until almost 10:30. We noticed many other guests who walked in late. Thank you. The staff everywhere was amazing and friendly.The room was very clean and newly renovated or new build. Parking was free. Will definitely stay here if we are required to use the PHL airport.Hello,Thank you so much. We strive to provide outstanding service at all times. I will be sure to share your feedback with the breakfast ladies and the rest of the team. Please come back and see us if you are ever in the Philadelphia area.Yours in hospitality,Paulette M.
1867	4	Stayed one night before flight out. Very close to airport, clean rooms and helpful staff.
1868	4	Good stay here. I don't generally nit pick about stuff, but my only issue is that the floors are thin. You could hear the above occupants walking all over their room. Thankfully, they went to bed at a decent hour, lol. My son has to swim in EVERY single pool at EVERY hotel we stay in. The pool here is HEAVILY chorinated. Even after he showered he smelled like chlorine and you couldn't even really see the bottom.of the pool. Overall good stay. Staff is super pleasant and helpful. I wanted to thank you for sharing your feedback with us here on Tripadvisor. I will be sure to relay your concerns regarding the pool. We do test our levels multiple times per day and we have an outside company that does this for us as well. I have not received any results back that our levels were over the threshold, but we will be sure to look into it. Thank you very much for staying with us.
1869	4	My husband and I were leaving on an 8 am flight to Orlando to go to Disney World with our Son, Daughter-in-Law, and 2 grandchildren (Age 4 8). We normally have a minimal of 45 min ride to the airport, so I decided to give the kids (and us) more sleep, we would stay the night. It was such a nice place to stay---they even kept our car parked while we were gone. I would highly recommend it.Hello!Thank you so much for your review. Our guest love using the Park Here, Fly There Package. It is truly a favorite. We would be honored for you to come back and stay with us again in the future.Yours in hospitality,Paulette M.
1870	5	the Fairfield inn staff was amazing everyone was super nice and eager to help us, I was traveling with a group of friends for a concert and I left my charger at home, the night staff member Anthony gave me his personal charger, I have never experienced that level of customer service every time I encountered Anthony during my stay he was smiling and eager to help even when we left for a 4 am flight he rushed over to the kitchen and got us yogurt and bagels. The Fairfield inn is my choice when I travel to Philadelphia.Thank you for making the Fairfield Inn/Mariott your choice hotel, we are excited that we made your stay amazing. I will ensure to inform Anthony and my team of the amzing service they provided to you. Should you require any further assistance please feel free to contact the hotel.Thank youFaith JonesAssistant General Manager
1871	3	Nothing really special about this Fairfield, located neat Philadelphia Airport. We stayed because we got a terrific rate, which made it worthwhile. Tons of very loud kids in the pool and whirlpool, which was annoying. Management didn't seem to be in the mood to enforce any of the rules against, for example, jumping and kids without adults. Heavy security measures at the front door are a bit off-putting, but once you're past them, this is a typical Fairfield. Decent breakfast.
1872	4	Our family of four (2 adults, 2 kids) stayed here while in town for a family visit. We found the location of the hotel to be convenient, as we went into the city, and out to the southwestern suburbs. Check-in went very smoothly and the staff was very courteous. We found our room to be very clean and the bed was comfortable. We heard some cars drag racing late at night, but did not hear any of the airplane traffic from the nearby airport. We had the continental breakfast and we were happy with it. Our only disappointment came on the second night of our stay. The pool was shut down because of a broken pump. That was a little disappointing for the kids, as they had swam the night before and had a good time, but, those things happen... Overall, we had a nice stay.Hello,Thank you very much for your feedback. We accept any and all feedback in a positive manner! Yes, I am extremely sorry for the inconvenience. We also needed to ensure the chemical levels were at the right levels before opening it back up. Thank you for your understanding. We would love another opportunity to serve you again in the future!Yours in hospitality,Paulette MooreGeneral Manager
1873	5	I loved this hotel. The staff was very friendly and the room was impeccably clean. Great place for children and close to restaurants and highway. They also offered complimentary breakfast which was delicious. The pool was clean the only drawback was the exercise equipment could have been updated.Hello,We sincerely appreciate and value any and all feedback to ensure continuous outstanding service. Thank you so much for taking the time to provide your feedback. I will most certainly look into your suggestion! We look forward to serving you again in the future!Yours in hospitality,Paulette M.
1874	4	We stayed at the Biltmore recently and it's a very nice upscale hotel. I will say that while the room was large and the beds were very comfortable that the furnishings in the room are a bit dated and not quite what you would expect from a hotel at this level. There are nice cheaper hotels in the area but... More
1875	5	The staff member Cheyenne was absolutely personable and helpful during my stay, She made sure my room was adequate and informed me of the happenings in the lovely area of Buckhead. If you make a reservation, Ask for Cheyeene.
1876	3	I stayed in February 2013. The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was nice, pastries, waffles, juice, bagels, etc. I saw other guests around the hotel that looked fine and some others that looked shady. The condition of the outside of the hotel could use some work. My room appeared clean and in good condition with the exception of stains on the carpet, a rocking toilet, and water stains in the cabinet under the sink. The rooms are spacious and really comfortable with two TVs. The location was great. It's really close to Piedmont St. and a really nice neighborhood. Not a far drive from the interstate. It's about 5-10 mins from Peachtree which has lots of shopping, dining, and entertainment. It's about 30 mins from the GA Intl Convention Center and the airport. I thought the hotel was a major bargain as I booked it on hotels.com for 63 but one major complaint was the lack of soundproofing. I had some obnoxiously loud people above me that appeared to be stomping on the floor for about 10 mins. I heard conversations in the room next to me. And I heard every person that went up or down the stairs outside my door.Thank you for your recent feedback of our property. I am glad to hear that you were pleased with the breakfast, helpfulness of our staff, and cleanliness of the room. I am also happy to hear that you found the location of our property convenient to shopping and dining. Hopefully you had the opportunity to sample some of the many fine dining establishments that are in close proximity of our hotelI am sorry to hear that you had issues with noise from the surrounding rooms and stairs. Unfortunately, we were unaware of these problems at the time so were unable to address them. We do always try our best to allocate rooms based on the nature of stay: business or leisure, to ensure our guests are as comfortable as possible. I hope you will give us the opportunity to serve you again in the future and make your experience with us a totally positive one!
1877	2	Our group stayed over a weekend for a trade show.Overall it was just an OK stay. Pool was closed. Gym was ok.The room smelled fine but when we returned in the evening it began to smell kinda moldy. Our TV was vintage 1990's and matched the rest of the room.In the morning we went for breakfast and they ran out of food for a good 15 minutes. Everyone ate cereal and got out out. It's a hotel. They have a breakfast rush every morning. I would expect there to be someone monitoring the food.On the other hand the Coffee was great! They also have a pancake machine! For triple digits I'm disappointed with the stay. Will stay elsewhere next time.Dear lllClifflll,Thank you for choosing the Holiday Inn Express Buckhead and for sharing your experience with us. Sorry to hear you did not have a completely satisfied stay. We do apologize for any inconvenience caused at the breakfast. This is certainly not a norm for our hotel and we would definitely look into that. Again, we thank you for your feedback and hope you'll give us another chance to welcome you back and see how we have improved. Sincerely,Lin S.IHGCare
1878	5	It was an amazing stay as usual. Customer service is A++. Shane at the front desk is awesome and friendly. The manager Noelle is a breathe of fresh air.The rooms are spacious and clean.

1881	3	This hotel has the potential to be very good but is let down by an overall tired level of decor in most of the rooms. A wet bathroom floor from a persistently dripping toilet, doors that did not shut properly, odd holes and dents in doors and walls, stained carpets and so on. If you an overseas traveller and really need wi-fi then I'd suggest you go somewhere else. In a 3 week USA vacation this was the worst wi-fi ever. If you could get a signal then it would frequently drop out. The front desk was not at all sympathetic and frankly turned us off this place altogether - a real shame as it has potential. I hope the new owners are able to view what needs to be done from a customer perspective and it might improveDear RomanRemains,Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for failing to exceed your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you provided to make improvements to ensure we offer an exceptional experience for our guests in the future. Please know that our hotel is currently undergoing room upgrades and property beautification in order to better serve our guests. We hope you'll return again in the future, so you're able to enjoy these improvements. I will make certain our internet provider is made aware of the spotty reception you received, and will look into the response that you were given by our front desk staff.I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience. Sincerely,Noelle TaylorFront Office Manager Quality Suites-Buckhead Village
1882	4	I have stayed at this hotel numerous times and feel like it is a very comfortable hotel at a very reasonable price. It is located in a unique wooded setting. On my most recent stay, Patricia was very helpful and considerate.Thank you for your comments on your most recent stay at the hotel. I thank you for recognizing Patricia and the quaint setting of the hotel and rooms. Thank you and see you again on your return trip!
1883	2	Stayed there for 3 nights and can't wait to get out. Upon check in, there was no smile, or welcome, front desk staff looked really tired. Upon entering the room, small pieces of trash found next to sofa and bed, sign of not vacuuming. Upon entering the bathroom, ultra small space, broken towel handle, only 2 towels on rack. No sheets for sofa bed although we stated the room was for 2 adults and 2 kids. Called for sheets and pillows, went out to dinner and back, still nothing. 9am, went to front desk to get our sheets. I mean, we really don't mind to stop by the front desk if the staff had told us that she's busy. Communication broken right there. Breakfast is nothing to write home about which we expected. Breakfast area very tight and small, if you're going to eat during busy time, go early, otherwise, no table for you. Next day went to visit Atlanta, came back at night found that both bed and sofa bed were made, satisfaction didn't last 2 seconds when seeing our pillows and our kids' stuff animals were on the floor. Obviously, the maid came to make bed, threw everything on the floor, and forgot to pick them up. But that also tell us how inconsiderate were they. Would you ever throw your bed pillows on floor, and Did I mention if they even vacuum. Would not recommend, there is Residence Inn just 2 minutes away. We didn't use their kitchen, so no commend on it, we just need a place a little bigger since we have kids.Thank you for your survey. I am truly sorry about your experience with our hotel. I will address all the matters you have detailed with housekeeping, front desk and food service. Again, I am sorry for not meeting your expectations.
1884	4	The hotel was easy to find. Was greeted immediately by Noel when I arrived.The lobby is nice and smells great. The gift shop was accessible off the lobby.This location in Buckhead area offers easy access to the mall, restaurants, etc.My room was on the first floor - I could not get over how large the rooms were - an added perk. The housekeeping staff really takes pride in offering you a cleanguestroom. The breakfast offered in the lobby daily has alot to offer - you will not leave hungry. I also enjoyed the Wednesday night Manager's Reception - niceto see the ownership cares about the customer for a change. I will be back herethe cost was reasonable, the rooms are large and the location WOW ! They also offer two meeting rooms and an outdoor pool and patio area for you to enjoy. You need to check this hotel out.Thank you for taking the time to complete our online review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests. We hope to see you again soon! Sincerely, Cassandra Lavie Guest Relations Manager Quality Suites-Buckhead Village 404-262-7880
1885	4	This hotel was convenient to our points of interest: Atlanta History Ctr/Swan House/Marta/restaurants, etc. VERY reasonably priced...........great breakfast. 2bdrm suite with kitchen and living rm was well-appointed and comfortable. Another plus was the shuttle. Only suggestion: time to upgrade the sheets and pillows.........they were quite thin.Thank you for your feedback. We appreciate your kudos about our room, location, breakfast and shuttle, as well as also your comments about areas where improvements can be made. We would like to inform you that all our linens will be replaced in our upcoming renovations which we hope to begin within the next couple of months.We thank you for your business and hope to see you again soon!
1886	5	One of the quietest places we have stayed at. Very Clean. Everyone smiling and helpful. Did I say clean and quiet on the 4th of July weekend. Real people work here and stay here. Away from the path usually taken and worth it. The White mountains are a great place to travel around.
1887	5	The hotel is located in North Phoenix just off I-17 and with only a short drive to the 101 and 303 loops, it provides good access to the metropolitan area. A wide range of restaurants and shopping is within a five minute drive. The hotel itself is very clean and modern. We had a spacious king bed studio which was extremely comfortable. The swimming pool is large, almost like a double pool and is shared with the Marriott Courtyard next door. There are plenty sun beds and on most occasions only a handful of people were using the facility. We loved the complimentary managers reception on Monday through Wednesday. The food was terrific, accompanied by beer,wine and soft drinks. Breakfast every day was also very good. The service we received was excellent. All the staff whatever their job, were friendly, but respectful and very efficient. This was our first stay in a Residence Inn and we were very impressed!Dear MoJoTours,Thank you so much for providing your feedback. I am so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. We hope to see you again on your next trip into Phoenix!
1888	5	Stayed here for my son's Basic Training graduation at Ft. Benning. Close to the base and restaurants. Service was excellent. Room was very clean. I would recommend staying here for anyone attending a graduation on the base.We are so happy that you chose us to stay with while you were visiting your soldier! I am truly happy that you enjoyed your stay. We hope to see you again soon!
1889	5	We arrived in PC on a Friday afternoon. After driving for a hour looking for some where to stay. We found this hotel. It's a little dated, but very clean. The staff was very nice and helpful. We would stay there again.Thank you so much for your business and review. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay and hope you'll be visiting again very soon!
1890	2	I found the 3 rd fl hallway smelling like mildew. Breakfast service was poor - ending up going out for breakfast. Hilton is just down the street with a steak house - - will stay there next trip down to Naples.
1891	5	Great location on 41 in North Naples near the Mercado. About 15 minutes from downtown Naples. Spacious 2 room suites, very comfortable beds, large bathroom, plenty of closet and drawer space. Very, very clean. Delicious cookies. Staff very attentive and courteous.
1892	5	Their staff is incredibly friendly and very welcoming. They give you a free cookie every day! The food (served by the pool) was super delicious. We ordered the food and they were so nice brought it out for us. Any little thing we wanted, they would get for us with no hesitation. They would go above and beyond for... More
1893	5	My stay here was excellent. The two women at the front desk were so helpful and inviting from the second we walked in the door. The check in-time was quick and efficient. After a long work day the best thing would be a nice warm cookie and they had those waiting for us.
1894	5	I had a great time at the Double Tree Hilton at Naples. I was having such a great time that at check out I misplaced my keys. The staff went out of their way to search for my keys when I returned two hours later. This was amazing because they not only looked in the room but went as far... More
1895	5	The hotel is nice and clean and the staff is very nice and helpful. The room was nice and we couldn't hear anything from the room next door it was awesome. Continental breakfast was exactly what it says.
1896	4	Staff very helpful and professional. Furniture was slightly warn compared to other similarly priced hotels in the area. Internet service came in handy and very consistent. Breakfast add on was a plus, very good, the buffet bar could have more fruit selections, but overall the food was very good and definitely a valued add on.
1897	3	I made the reservations on line. I chose a waterfront balcony room. Well, we were on the waterfront but we were on the first floor with a tall hedge and busily traveled boardwalk. There was a small sitting area but certainly not what I was expecting. I requested a room near one of our friends (2nd floor). We made do... More
1898	5	Always a pleasure to stay at this hotel. Rooms and management are excellent. Convenient location just off the interstate with plenty of options to eat and shop. Rooms are always clean and well maintained as are the grounds, with ample parking close to rooms. Wouldn't stay anywhere else.
1899	4	Stayed there on business 2/16, extremely nice staff and the room was exceptionally quiet. Be sure and plan ahead and allow extra time due to the highway construction. This place is an absolute bear to find at night due to the construction.
1900	4	The hotel is older and slowly making the necessary renovations evident in our hotel room, bathroom updated, but dresser and counter still waiting to be updated, however it meets all basic needs with a nice swimming pool area. The breakfast was perfect each morning, clean environment and tasty food. We had a medical emergency with my son's asthma and had... More
1901	3	Everyone at the Baymont hotel was very friendly and helpful. We how ever did not get the room we had booked and paid for. Beds were comfortable and breakfast was always great. Great location for lots of things to do.
1902	1	Checked in and had to change rooms 4 times...very dissapointed with the facility! The air condition didn't work proper in all 4 rooms period. The rooms were dirty and smelled foul! I talked with the manager in the morning and she basically didn't care or offer any refund. I had to have the agent from bookings.com get me out of... More
1903	3	It's a good deal for what you get, the room I had came with 2 doubles and a sofa bed with two separate rooms, sofa bed is far from comfortable, but again, the price isnt bad in comparison. Room also had two tvs and balcony. Staff was friendly and helpful.
1904	4	Property needs some upgrades. It's basic but the location is excellent. Run by a hard working family. No extras. The rooms may be a bit old but they are kept very clean. We were there for 3 nights so they chose a corner back room to minimize noise for us. We enjoyed it, except for the very hard beds. Two... More
1905	2	First impression was positive. However in 5 minutes I discovered that Wi-Fi doesn't work in the room. I asked a manager, she promised to repair it on the next day. I spend three nights in the hotel and nothing was changed with Wi-Fi. I had to work in garden (Wi-Fi worked outside), sometimes under grass sprinkles. Morning coffee finishes by 10 am. Living cockroaches in the room and dead in the bad. Afro-Americans knock to the door and ask for gasoline for their car because of pregnant wife. One positive point - 55 for a night, however I recommend to demolish it.
1906	3	My daughter and I had business to conduct an I was on a budget. It was close to Southwestern Medical Center. TV was good. Bathroom light fixture was tempermental. Room had zero privacy to dress. All in all, we got what we paid for and that's really all you can ask. Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to review. We are delighted to hear that your stay was satisfactory in terms of getting great value for the low budget. Each year we continue to make our guestrooms better and comfortable for our guest. I hope you decide to choose us again on your next visit so that we can make your stay great!
1907	5	I have stayed at a lot of budget friendly places in many states and this was one of the best. The staff were friendly, the room was clean, it had a microwave and fridge which was awesome. The location was perfect and very quiet I wasn't worried about my safety or my cars! I have never been to Dallas before but it seemed like everything was very close and easy to find. If we ever go back to Dallas we will definitely be staying here!
1908	4	This could be the best value in the Dallas area. Overall, my stay was quite enjoyable, especially considering the central location and price: 45 (with tax) a night. The no-frills yellow and blue exterior of this motel is a little funny. However, inside the room was very clean and updated, with a few prominent recent additions such as leather-like chairs and matching black-and-brown desk and nightstands, which between them have five drawers and two shelfs for ample storage . The carpet, sink, curtains, furniture, and flat screen TV all appear to be relatively new. I suppose they had to watch costs somewhere, so that explains the thin, colorful bed spread, bath-fitter style plastic tub and shower, and a clothing rack oddly affixed to a wall right by the bathroom sink. The amenities of free wi-fi and excellent housekeeping are things I appreciated. The property is in an underdeveloped area defined by a non-teaching hospital and a golf course, so don't expect to do anything within walking distance. It's conveinently located near a major highway, about 6 miles from downtown Dallas and 5 miles from the Uptown Area/Arts District. There are a few fast-food places within a minutes drive. The area is quiet and safe. Won't you wont get in your room are a sink inside the bathroom (it's separate and outside the bathroom), a closet, a refrigerator, an iron, a blow dryer, coffee pot and coffee, luxurious towels, body wash, or big fluffly pillows. But at this price, can you really complain
1909	4	We stayed a night to catch an early flight out of Love Field.I was a little skeptical about the part of town it's in,I know the surrounding area ,it's a little shady..Turns out the motel is located in a business area where nobody is around after business hours.Not bad at all.If you are a whiner about paying for a low end room and not getting a five star hotel this place is not for you.It's clean,quiet and fairly well maintained,well worth the cost.I will stay again now that I know about the place since it's less than five minuets from DAL.
1910	4	We had a great view of the arch from our room. The hotel had plenty of amenities including a pool, hot tub, fully equipped exercise room, and a game room that included an air hockey table. The rooms and bathroom were clean, and the breakfast was good. The breakfast attendant was the most attentive I have ever seen, she was... More
1911	5	This hotel is amazing. I say hotel because it is more like a hunting lodge. Grand lobby with large stone fireplace with pool room off to the side. Amazing wrap around porch that also houses comfortable rocking chairs and tables over looking what can only be described as one amazing mountain view. My husband and I stayed here over New... More
1912	5	We stopped here on the way to Florida. The gentleman (Jay) at the front desk was sooooo nice. We loved the big, fluffy towels and clean room. There was a microwave and a refrigerator. It was quiet and the air worked great too.
1913	5	I've stayed at the Hampton Elkins, West Virginia for four years and my experience has always been excellent. The staff are always willing to help and very pleasant. The complimentary breakfast is great.
1914	5	Great location had a great time! recommend this Motel. The view from our room was beautiful. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. Thank you for a enjoyable stay. Breakfast was very good, coffee was excellent. A special thank you to all staff who was extremely helpful and accomodating.
1915	5	Excellent my best hotel experience yet ! Customer service above and beyond Debra the kitchen Manager, Maria W., Geeta, Cassandra, Karl, Mark, Emiliano, Alan, Tamara... Guest Services ... Nick, Victor,Anntoinette, Uybens, Pierre, Debra Maintenance : Antonio ,Prince ....
1916	5	Front desk was always kind and helpful. Place was clean and quiet. Near some good restaurants within walking distance. Nice breakfast and lounge area. Parking came at a cost but the charge was less than other hotels in the area. Would definitely stay there again for business.
1917	5	After a long drive decided to go downstairs to The Bistro for dinner. Roberto recommended the backed chicken dinner with the salad. I like to eat healthy. The chicken was delicious, hot, and a large portion. The salad was fresh and plenty of variety of veggies. The overall dinner was great and reasonably priced. Roberto provided outstanding service and super friendly. I felt right at home :-)Thank you WalshS101 for sharing the experience you had at our Bistro. The Bistro concept was created to give our guest a convenient location to enjoy fresh food options. It is great to hear that Roberto gave outstanding service. I will make sure to share your comments with him.We hope that you will be back to visit us again. Please contact our front desk if you need any assistance booking a future reservation. Thank you and have a great day.
1918	5	What a perfect experience. The employees,the food,the service,even the parking was fantastic.Maria and Nick took excellent care of us.Everyone was polite and genuine. The room was very clean and neat.We found no problems of any kind. Next time,we will not even look around. We will stay there.Mel K,Thank you for sharing your experience! I'm glad Maria and Nick was able to exceed our expectations while staying with us! Our goal is for every guest to experience a problem free stay at your hotel. Please come back to see us when your travels bring you back to Orlando.
1919	2	We stayed at this Courtyard in Oct. 2007, and booked well in advance of our arrival. We used marriott.com to book the room, and reserved a room with two double beds and a balcony (the website lists details about each room type available).Upon arriving at the hotel, the front desk clerk (only one for a line of 5 parties checking-in) advised us that our room was XYZ. When I asked if the room had a balcony and two beds, he said that there were no rooms of that type left. We had a dialogue back and forth, and I said that I reserved a room with a balcony and two beds, and that's what I wanted to get, or else I would go to the Hilton Garden Inn, where I am a Hilton Silver member and spend about 50 less per night. The clerk pulled up the hotel web site and tried to insist to me that a specific room type is not guaranteed rather, they are just guidelines. However, I made it very clear that each available room type listed amenities specific to that room (i.e. double balcony room, XYZ square feet, balcony XYZ square feet, etc.). He was very insistent and offended me with his refusal to admit that, in this case, I was right. To make a long story short, the clerk accomodated us with a one queen bed plus sofabed room with a balcony. The importance of the balcony was because my friend smokes and the entire hotel is smoke-free otherwise. Why the clerk had not suggested this prior to our 15 minute debate is beyond me. Not a good start to this stay.On to the hotel property and facilities. There is plenty of parking. Even with the Mountain Dew/X games convention staying there, there was plenty of parking available, even late at night,. The hotel facilities are relatively new, with lots of bright light and marble. Rooms are decorated nicely, but are average in size. The bed was very comfortable I was told the sofa bed was not that comortable (to be expected, I guess). The balcony was definitely a good size, but overlooked the gas station next door. The bathroom was small, but had good water pressure and a massaging shower head.With regards to the Courtyard's location, I would not say it is unsafe. It is located in downtown Orlando. If you are intimidated by being in a city, then you will most likely be intimidated by the hotel's location. However, there is no need to worry about running into trouble in this part of the city. Simply follow normal night time procedures for being aware of your surroundings, as you should anywhere after dark. The biggest complaint I had about this stay was the noise level. Due to there being tons of teenagers staying here with the previously mentioned convention, we heard yelling and skateboarding in the parking lot at all hours of the night. We also heard other guests yelling out their sliding doors for them to shut up, and arguments ensued. This was around 4-5am. Hotel staff, where were you Someone needed to get this rediculous noise under control. The walls here are very thin, and banging could be heard on adjacent floors of the hotel.The air conditioner in our room would not cool adequately. Even on the high cool setting, it would turn off at about 72 degrees I would say. So after spending the day in the 90+ degree heat, we couldn't get cooled down well enough. And at night it was rather warm. Not to mention that the A/C could not drown out all the noise, because it was off most of the time. There is no constant cool option to override the auto thermostat temp feature of the A/C. Both low cool and high cool switch on and off based on the temp you select. So overall, I was not impressed by the service or general atmosphere of this Courtyard. I have stayed at Hampton Inns that are much nicer, with better customer service. This stay confirmed for me why I frequent Hiltons and their sister properties as opposed to Marriotts. I would not recommend this hotel based on my stay. There are many other fine hotels of this caliber in Orlando, so do yourself a favor and stay at one of the them.
1920	5	Ive stayed at many Marriotts over the years and the customer service at this Courtyard Marriott is hands down the best!Everyone is super friendly and calls you by name I highly recommend when traveling for any reason that you stay here.Dear JHarris,Thank you for selecting the Courtyard in Downtown Orlando for your time in Central Florida. We could not be happier to have received this fabulous review. Its also lovely to hear that our staff did such a great job welcoming you and taking care of your needs while at the hotel. We hope we will have the pleasure of welcoming you back as our valued guest when you return to Orlando. Have a great week and travel safely.
1921	5	Only suppose to stay two nights, it rained for those two days, so we stayed another night, the staff helped in booking the extra day was no hassle, the pool was perfect!!!, the Gym was right on time, and the breakfast was excellent, hot coffee 24/7... Im even thinking of coming back next year... Great vacation!!!
1922	5	This is an excellent location to stay at no matter which park you are visiting. Great rooms, clean and roomy. Our room had couch and kitchen area (sink, cabinets, fridge, and microwave). The nightly rate was more than reasonable.
1923	5	This hotel was very nice for a family vacation. We stayed for the weekend to go to SeaWorld and Aquatica which are right next to hotel, which was great. Breakfast is free every day and delicious. The staff was professional and courteous. The room was large and big enough for two adults and two teenagers. We had a studio suite that comes with a sofa bed. I would definitely stay again for my next visit, affordable and well maintained.
1924	5	Very happy to visit the Hampton. Easy check-in and check-out. The room was very clean so overall we were happy with our stay. Only real problem was that the business center PCs need fixed because the browser crashed continually during my attempts to do my airline check-in
1925	5	Our staycay for our family of 6 was a great experience. Our suite was large and provided room for the kids to move around. Kitchen with microwave saved us money since we could pop popcorn and make other snacks as needed. Extra charging outlets were a plus to all of us. We are planning our next staycay already! Walking distance to Seaworld. Shuttles available to all surrounding theme parks even Busch Gardens in Tampa!
1926	4	We stayed here for 11 days just after spring break in the suites. As the hotel is newer (2 years old) it was in good condition and modern, one of the main reasons I chose it as some other properties are getting old and tired.It has a great location with easy access by car to Disney, Seaworld (across the road), airport, International drive and outlets shops, very central to most areas. It has an access point onto the i4 on the doorstep and the 528 nearby.We chose the suites as we wanted room for such a long stay as on previous stays at Hampton Inn's we have found the standard room cramped. The room is very spacious and comfortable with beds, large desk, sofa and basic kitchenette (a sink, fridge microwave). It's worth the few extra dollars if you can afford it. The only down side to the rooms was a big lack of clothes storage areas (3 small drawers 7 hangers in wardrobe) and no plates/utensils in the kitchenette to eat from.We did have noise from the floor above and had to call reception one night to get them call the room above to quiet down at 11pm. The rooms were serviced each day but the level of cleaning was pretty poor - no change of sheets and tiled floor filthy and had to wear shoes in room or got black feet.The breakfast area is nice with quiet a good selection to each and drink. They also have a little food shop near reception which we found really handy for light meals and a bear when we didn't want to go out at night.The pool area was very clean with lots of sunbeds and chairs to use. It would be nice if they heated the pool as the water was uncomfortably cold unless you were doing laps.It is linked to Seaworld and some great perks so you should look into this if you are intending to go.There are also trolley stops nearby which can take you to outlets, international drive and universal (but not Disney) which is handy if you don't have a car.There was no safe in the room or safety deposit boxes at reception, as Orlando has a reputation for hotel break-ins I found this odd and an area they should seriously address.The staff for the most part were disinterested and very causal (no uniforms at reception), for such a nice hotel this was a disappointment. Overall a good choice but not on the 'must' visit again list.
1927	3	Too noisey if you need a good nights rest. People and kids in hallways very loud up and down on the elevator(our room was next to the elevator). Was told I got a discount with my AARP but it did not show up on my final statement after I returned home.The young lady at the front desk spoke very limited English and did not understand my complaint the next day. Breakfast was very good and available nice and early for people who need to leave early.
1928	5	We stayed in this hotel for a quick weekend trip. The property is very new and the interior was beautifully decorated and clean. The location was a fairly short distance from all of the main parks/malls in Orlando, without all of the craziness of being right in the middle of everything. It was within walking distance of bone fish grill and a short drive from a bunch of other cool restaurants.Some reviews had mentioned construction noise which worried me initially, but we stayed there on a Friday and Saturday night and didn't hear a thing. The front desk agent (Nick) was very helpful and friendly, which started everything off on the right foot. I would definitely recommend this place!
1929	3	Great breakfast, good location, good customer service, and dirty rooms. Brand new hotel but both rooms were dirty. Food on the floors of both rooms, pretzels and Cheerios, and hair in the beds and shower...
1930	3	This is a brand new hotel in what seems to be a newly developing area near sea world. That being said, there's a lot of construction on additional hotels right next door. Every day during our week stay, there were people working, tractors moving and beeping at the crack of dawn and late into the afternoon. Also, I shared a room with the a coworker, although I appreciate the nice design of a hanging barn door for the bathroom, I think adding a lock would've been a good call. No lock on the bathroom door is a little awkward. The track was also not level on the door so it would slowly open when you tried to close it all the way. We had to resort to wedging a towel between the door and the threshold to keep it from rolling open. That aside, the hotel has everything you need, free breakfast in the morning, business center, and a cvs close by. If you're a budget traveler or just need a basic room for business, this is a good one.
1931	4	Nicely appointed Hampton Inn that opened in 2015. Good service. Comfortable beds. Very close to Sea World with shuttle service to the local parks. Lower rates than some of the other Hampton Inns in the area.
1932	5	Looking at hotels in the seaworld area I came across this one. In price comparison it was very well priced. The quality of stay was great! Room didn't lack anything. It was clean. And free, included breakfast was awesome.
1933	5	Very spacious and pleasant room, easily accessible. Breakfast was very good with plenty of selections and comfortable surroundings. There were five in our party, three children and two adults, and the room easily accommodated us with two queen size beds and a fold-out double bed, but a spacious area for all.Dear Ernest H,Thank you so much for taking the time to provide us feedback about our property and for choosing us for your trip. We are so thrilled that your stay with us was pleasant and that your party was comfortably accommodated! We truly hope you enjoyed your experience at our Hampton Inn Suites location and we look forward to seeing you all very soon!
1934	5	Location to Sea World is perfect, dcor is Sea World themed. Hotel was very clean and comfortable, perfect for single people or families. With 5 people we got a larger room with pullout sofa and small bar area, I will be looking for this size room again, we loved it! Breakfast area was great. Will definitely stay here again.
1935	5	Beautifully decorated and new! Comfy beds and clean bathroom! Friendly staff! The breakfast was the typical Hampton breakfast and the meat/egg choice changed each morning. A nice topping bar for the waffles and oatmeal. This Hampton didn't disappoint! Very close to Sea World! NOT terribly far from Disney parks either. NO restaurants in walking distance.
1936	5	We had the wet bar suite and it was really spacious and nice for our family.Breakfast was great! Staff was super friendly and you are close to everything Disney and on I drive.We needed a pack and play for the little one and they had one ready which was nice.
1937	5	Stayed at this hotel for business and was delightfully surprised. The hotel is new, so it was VERY CLEAN, cool, spacious rooms, excellent breakfast and awesome location by Sea World. Also, it was a short 15 minute drive to the Orlando Airport. Very affordable hotel and certainly a step above a typical Hampton Inn. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, taking the time to make sure our group was satisfied. Nick at the front desk was really great our entire stay and we all appreciated his efforts to make sure we were pleased.
1938	4	I had five nights in this hotel the room was clean, room was a good size. I like it as you didn't have to pass reception every time you left and arrived. It is not far from Peachtree station and walking distance to most attractions. Car rentals right next door if needed
1939	1	Now like most reasonable people whove traveled a lot, we understand when you make a special request, motels cant always meet them. Were okay with that.What were not okay with is when motel proprietors make up silly excuses to avoid honoring advertised claims. And were also not okay with being threatened with refusal of service. Thats exactly what happened to us here.This was to be our 36th hotel stay in almost six months of travel across North America, and our first experience with the Motel 6 chain. It will also be our last.We booked a week prior to our stay through the Motel 6s national website, requesting a room with a fridge in our booking comments. The national (mobile) website lists an amenity for this motel as Free microfridge/some rooms. We received a confirmation booking email from Motel 6, showing our rate and our request.We read the statement Free microfridge/some rooms as some rooms (not all), have free mini-fridges. On check in, we were presented with a credit card charge that exceeded the amount in our confirmation email. On querying the difference, it was firstly explained as sales tax. Now whilst we mightnt be actuaries, even we could see the difference far exceeded any sales tax value and on querying further it became obvious there was a charge for the fridge. Sometimes misunderstandings and miscommunications occur. And were reasonable people willing to overlook issues if theres a valid explanation or compromise. This motel refused to honor the free part of the statement, offering that to us for an additional charge and suggesting that as it wasnt their personal website, there was no obligation on them to do so. The comedy routine got better though.We were asked for and provided evidence of our booking, and of the statement on the Motel 6 website (it was more a demand as in what website says that). The gentleman we dealt with was not prepared to compromise on this point however. He was insistent on making his point, which simply was that the rate in his computer system for rooms with fridges, was a higher rate.That he was rude, threatening and unwilling to compromise on such a minor point, and with such unreasonable excuses made us wonder if we were on one of those reality comedy shows you know the ones where people are deliberately rude and antagonistic, and then the camera crew rushes out and surprises you and everyone laughs. We saw no camera crew however and the comedy routine continued with him suggesting we cant just give things away. In our view, and for most other reasonable people, failing to honor advertised claims amounts to misleading and deceptive conduct. Giving an unreasonable excuse to disassociate a chain-branded property from its national brand simply to avoid honoring a small commitment demonstrates a lack of integrity. We also contacted Motel 6s national office via their website about our issue. On the first occasion they misread our concern, seeing it simply as being we asked for a fridge and didnt get one. On the second occasion, we received exactly the same worded, trained-monkey, form-letter response including (the almost condescending): the experience as you described, concerns us deeply. And the promised action on both counts Well send your comments to our Management Team for their review. Interpreted as were not going to do anything with your comments but hey, thanks for wasting your time and effort!We dont appreciate or accept this type of behaviour, and chose to take our business elsewhere. And were no longer waiting for the camera crew to appear.
1940	4	While I thought, initially, that the neighbourhood this motel was in was sketchy, that quickly faded when I realized how good this place was. The front desk staff, Ben, was uber-helpful and friendly, and really made an effort to know my name and my needs. It's very centrally located in Atlanta, with quick access to the MARTA subway system, and was walkable to a lot of different restaurants and sites. The room was nice and clean, and more than serviceable. The price was right too, although there was a mix-up with the pricing. They did however fix it promptly. I was also able to check in early without a charge, which was also a great benefit.
1941	2	Jake at reception is an amazing guy and wifi works perfectly! But the rest of the hotel is a mess. Rooms smell, the woman at reception kept me waiting outside the lobby for 10min while she decided to open the door. Hair in the sheets. Ice machine makes so much noise you can't sleep. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else.Dear Arturo, Thank you for sharing your review. We strive to provide a comfortable night's rest and are disappointed your stay was unsatisfactory due to the odor concern you describe. Please know that the conditions you describe are atypical to Motel 6 standards for quality and we apologize for the inconveniences you experienced. Our standards for quality rest on the promise to offer the lowest price of any national chain by delivering the essential elements of a comfortable room for a satisfying stay, for this reason we apologize for the disappointment you describe with the expectations of amenities. We invite you to contact our Guest Relations department at 1-855-787-9864 to record the details of your visit to help us provide a better guest experience in the future.
1942	3	Great budget hotel for a two night stay whilst travelling, excellent location within walking distance to bars restaurants and shops, whilst the rooms were very basic they were clean and comfortable, staff were friendly and helpful.
1943	4	Ben, the receptionist, was very very friendly so the first impression was a big surprise! The motel looks clean and is located next to the highway in Atlanta Downtown. As you can imagine opening the window is a bad idea because it's getting very noisy but if you leave them closed you won't hear the cars that much. I was able to sleep like a baby :)If you visit Atlanta without a car, no worries, nearly every attraction (Georgia Aquarium, Coke museum, etc) is in walking distance. A MARTA station is about 10min away.On our floor there were vending machines (snacks and drinks) and the prices were reasonable. The room is quite big, for 2 persons it's enough room. The interior is a bit worn out but the price is more than fair.
1944	1	I stayed here back in February. Didn't have the greatest stay. My comments can be found in a previous review. After all was said and done the first time, the GM sent me 2 free night vouchers to use at any Residence Inn in the country. That was all well and good and I thought I was done with my bad stay. But those vouchers came back to haunt me as I went to use them in St Louis and I was told that marriott had stopped using those 2 years ago and they were no good. How embarrassing! The people in St Louis were great. Very helpful with the situation. I'd recommend never staying here again. In the end they ending up paying for my night in St Louis and giving me some points. Doesn't make up for the embarrassing situation. I even called marriott corporate in regards to the situation. Thank you so much for taking time to help us to understand what happened to you. Please accept our apology as a team. The challenge you experienced in St Louis was handled beautifully by their staff and followed up by our Leadership as they paid for the room nights directly. We appreciate your loyalty to Marriott and look forward to a long and successful relationship.
1945	3	Honestly, the size of the room was great. I had my fiance' and my two teen sons with me. My son's switched out the bedroom, because we were there two nights. While one was sleeping in the bedroom, the other slept on the couch. We had attempted to pull out the sleeper sofa, but decided against it because we found cookie crumbs and other items underneath the mattress. The couch itself didn't look that clean, so I bought new linen and he slept on it instead. There was the hassle of using the key card everywhere, but when it comes to safety, I'd rather be safe than sorry. There was also the issue of how our room was being paid, we secured the deposit with a credit card, but when we got there, we wanted to pay with cash. But everything was quickly cleared up with a phone call to the manager. Overall, our stay there was pleasant. I would definitely stay here again.Thank you for taking time to share your experience with us. We consistently work to address the concerns our guests have shared. Please consider joining us again soon and allowing us the opportunity to meet and exceed your expectations. Have a great day. Lynn Martin, General Manager
1946	4	Del Sol Inn on Harbor Blvd. is all about the location if you want to go to Disneyland. The rooms are charming, but if you are looking for upscale accommodations, this is not the hotel for you. The hotel offers a free breakfast, which is filling and convenient.
1947	3	Stayed here 4 nights with my family, booked the kids suite with bunk beds. Found the room spacious and clean and the grounds clean as well. The pool was well maintained and they even provided guest towels. Did not like the bed, found it uncomfortable and my teens felt the there was a lack of outlets for electronic devices. Loved the proximity to the Parks and restaurants. Did not care for the breakfast, feel that they should add a waffle maker or some other protein. The walls were thin and could here both the upstairs and side neighbors, not bad if they actually sleep at a decent time.
1948	5	Most of the Harbor Boulevard hotels have come to a certain accommodation level somewhere between an Econolodge and a Holiday Inn Express, so there's not a lot to say about the style of the property except what distinguishes it from its sister hotels up and down the street.Google maps is a great way to see exactly how convenient a hotel is to the Disneyland Resort. You basically have two ways to get in - one from the west and one from the east. On the west side is the Disneyland family of hotels and Downtown Disney, so staying on that side you have to go through all that to get to the parks. On the east side, the pedestrian entrance is directly across from the IHOP at 1560 S Harbor Blvd, and when I say directly, you cross the street and you are walking into the front door of the IHOP.The absolute CLOSEST hotel is the Best Western Park Place, followed by the Desert Inn, then you have a tie with the Tropicana Inn and the Del Sol. It's actually closer to the park entrance from any of these hotels than staying at the Disneyland Hotel!I was at first skittish about the hotel for some of the reasons cited in other reviews. It's not a chain, the reviews are varied, and it just looks like it's in a weird place, set back from Harbor Boulevard behind Denny's.The good news is that my fears were unfounded. We had a quiet room with a well-maintained, satisfyingly consistently rumbling air conditioner. Microwave and Fridge in room, tube TV with good Dish network channel reception (SD, and oddly the locals were fuzzy.) Front desk was responsive. Bed was firm and comfortable. Iron and ironing board worked. Safe worked. Didn't use the in-room coffeemaker because we were right next to the breakfast room. Breakfast begins at 7, and is very limited, but serviceable.The big, big issue with the hotel is that they do not have enough parking. Which is *fine* if you plan ahead, and especially if you're spending your whole time at Disney. When they fill up, they start valeting cars. We were also in town for my cousin's wedding, and needed access to our vehicle more than a normal Disney vacationer would. You may want to plan ahead with extra tip money. The valets are available 24 hours, and if one's not visible, they'll call them. I needed my car at 5:00 a.m., and they were quick to respond and get it out... maybe a 15 minute wait.Oh, and for all you parking cost complainers, sorry - that's the price of business in southern California. The state park we went to for the rehearsal dinner had a 3 parking fee!We got our reservations to the Del Sol via Hotels.com on a special, and used one of our 1 free with 10 nights, so the four night stay was very reasonable in price. I would recommend it just as highly as the chain hotels, and would stay here again.
1949	3	We got a good deal through a third party. Room rate was 109 for New Year's Day. Hotel was 2 minute walk from Disney Land and near many food establishments. Rooms were old and relatively clean. Lighting was a bit dim for my taste. Small bathroom, but sink right outside. Had refrigerator and old rusting microwave. Bad news If you are on second floor, you are hauling your suitcases up the stairs. No elevator. Also the shades are plantation shutters that let the sun in at the crack of dawn. Don't forget the occasional roll of a suitcase right by your room, or housekeeping loudly rolling their cart by your room early in the morning. Oh, and for some reason housekeeping knocked on our door at 930AM just to say sorry!! All in all this is a convenience, inexpensive motel disguised as an inn. Clever naming! For the money, the stay was OK but would not repeat.
1950	4	If you are the type of family/group that likes a fine hotel with plush rooms and over the top customer service, this is not the hotel for you. This hotel has some thin walls, and really small parking spaces.However, this hotel is located directly across the street from the Disneyland's main entrance. It makes for easy access in the morning and at night when the last thing you want to do is take a tram back to the hotel or parking lot. Its location also makes the afternoon nap a definite possibility.Besides the location, it has a nice pool, comfortable beds, and it is plenty clean. The best part of this hotel is the AC that will cool down your room in under a minute, plus it gives you that AC sound that reminds you of how sweet vacation really is.
1951	5	We planned our family vacation and stayed at the Del Sol February 17-19, and we could have gotten any closer to the entrance of the park :) the rooms were clean and it was close to place we could walk to for shopping or a quick bite We arrived a bit early but were allowed to park so that we could enjoy Disneyland and not worry about checking in later in the day. Thank you for the great stay.
1952	5	We had looked around the area for an affordable yet clean hotel during our trips to Disneyland. We tend to stay overnight at least once a month in the area. We had stayed in several of the neighboring hotels and found them to be acceptable. In December of 2102 I booked several rooms at the Del Sol Inn for our family. I was very pleased with the staff during our check in process, who made us feel welcome. They were also very accommodating with our large group. The rooms are large and clean. The parking is good and the pool is very nice. Over all I have returned to the Del Sol Inn twice more and plan to us this as our favorite area hotel. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.
1953	4	Enjoyed staying here and having a continental breakfast. It is right across from Disney and that is perfect. Nice spacious rooms and a pool and hot tub if you want one. I was very pleased with this hotel!
1954	3	OK, so some people didn't like this or that but lets face it, have you checked the prices of the other Hotels Pay 100 more and you will get a better breakfast, or just have a coffee and a muffin and go to a restaurant for a better meal. You are here because it is inexpensive and the location is great. It's just that simple, you get what yo pay for. Interesting that if you pay 200 more, you probably wouldn't have to many complaints. Why are you here thenI will come back because we just want a simple place to sleep.Britisheh
1955	5	The staff was so nice and helpful. The rooms were great and very clean!
1956	4	We stayed here for a week during a Disneyland visit in June. The staff was very helpful. The continental breakfast was filling, but Denny's and IHOP are just a few steps away if you choose to sleep in. The rooms are large and clean. The best part is when you are tired from a long day at Disneyland your room is a very short walk away. The walk is 5 minutes or less.
1957	4	The hotel is close to the Disneyland entrance. The staff were pleasant and the room was clean and spacious. We will stay again next year. We didn't use the pool but it is a good size. We didn't take advantage of the breakfast which were included as we preferred to sleep in.
1958	3	Pros: The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our special needs.Cons: Water pressure needs to be addressed. Was almost impossible to take a shower.This hotel is right across the street from the Disneyland entrance. So convenient to come and go all day long. I have found that all hotels are about the same. Definitely not a 5 star place but its just a place to lay your head and rest up to play again the next day! Breakfast was very simple. Pastries, toast, oatmeal, cereal and juice. A very limited fruit selection was available as well. Water pressure was extremely low which made it difficult to shower. The hotel includes a pool and hot tub. The staff was super friendly. I will definitely plan to stay here again!
1959	5	The hotel is just right across the parks, perfect for people to spend more time in the park, the room is very clean comfortable, the staffs are helpful. There is a 24-hour Denny's restaurant right beside the hotel, which can feed your hungry tummy anytime.
1960	4	You can not say enough about the location of this place. If you stayed at any of Disney's resort hotels, you would be further away from the entrance than you are from this one. It is located just behind Denny's which saves you from the noise of Harbor. The hotel is an older one but we did not find it run down. The rooms were recently redone and the plumbing, heat (didn't use the AC), refrigerator and TV worked great. The place looked like it was recently painted and the carpeting looked new. The walls are a bit thin but with only 65 rooms it didn't matter. The plus side of being an older place is that the rooms were large in comparison to some of the newer places. The breakfast is nothing to write home about but it is better than others I have had in the area. I would recommend either Denny's or IHOP. We didn't use the pool or hot tub but others were and seeming to have a good time. When booking at their website, be sure to check for the specials which do not automatically come up on their reservation system. We found that we could get a 20 discount if you stayed three nights but had to call to the hotel and ask specifically for it to get it. It was worth the phone call as it brought our hotel bill down to 62 per night. We will stay again.
1961	4	My husband and I stayed at Del Sol Inn for two nights when visiting Disneyland. The location couldn't have been better - Disneyland was literary right across the street. Our room was large and well kept. There was a towel that had been shaped into an elephant, very cute! The free wifi worked well. Be advised that the password for the wifi is changed every Monday morning. We were not told of this when we checked in Saturday evening (and were staying two nights).Breakfast was ok I guess, I've definitely had better, but it was included in the price. There were many sweet options to choose from, but extremely few healthy ones. The seating area was very cramped.The rate was affordable when comparing to other motels / hotels with the same great location. I would definitely consider stay here again on my next visit to Disneyland.
1962	4	We stayed here for 4 nights in October and we booked a double queen room for three of us all adults. The room was huge and clean. I had requested an upstairs room because of reading earlier comments about noise from above in the lower rooms and we were given an upstairs room at the back of the Hotel.It was quiet and we had no issues with noise from the pool area which was just below us. There is no lift in the Hotel but I was prepared for this and knew I would need to carry may cases up the stairs.The provided breakfast was basic but very adequate, waffles, cereal, toast, eggs, juices, tea and coffee.The hotel is a little older than the ones around it and that is obvious when you arrive but we had no issues with cleanliness and I was not looking for 5 star just a good restful place to sleep.The location for the price was perfect, I would stay here again, no questions asked just for the location and price. The office staff were helpful and friendly, the manager even gave me some milk for a cuppa one night.We were here to see Disneyland not be in motel room so the only time we were were in our room was to sleep and this was a perfect place at a great price to do that.
1963	5	We stay here every time we go to Disneyland which is 2-3 times a year. It is right behind Denny's and the walk to Disneyland is about 5 minutes. The staff is always helpful and nice. The rooms are always clean and the maid service is really friendly and I love how they set up my kids toys when cleaning. Every time we come back to the room my kids love seeing that each touch.
1964	3	Positives- hotel is in a fabulous location as it's about 200m away from the main Disneyland walkway.- rooms are large and clean- bag storage upon check out- close to food outlets such as Denny's and Ihop.Negatives- at check in I was asked to provide a credit card which is standard, but what's not standard is for a hold of the full accommodation cost to be placed against my card, especially when I stated that I wished to pay by cash (and had it on me). I was not impressed by this as I am likely to be charged fees for going over my credit limit for this.- I had a room in the ground (level 1) and there is zero sound proofing between the floors - every morning I was woken at 6-6.30am by what sounded like a herd of elephants above me and when they turned on their water it was like a machine was turned on in my room (and 10x louder than me turning on my own shower).- drinks machine only takes coins- breakfast left little to be desired. Only had jelly to spread on toast. One morning there was no cups for juice, juice machine wasn't working and there was very little food.- parked cars allowed very little room to walk out of room and out of complexOverall whilst this location is great, I would pay a little more money and stay somewhere else close by.
1965	3	I have been to Disneyland 14 times and have stayed someplace different every time. The Del Sol Inn was a very good price and excellent location. The breakfast was standard continental breakfast, something quick and easy to eat. I just wish they had water available at breakfast. The room was quiet and clean and the bed was very comfortable. I have nothing really to complain about. I would stay here again for the right price.
1966	1	My family are Disney annual passholders so we wanted to drive up for an overnight and get an extra evening in. We decided to stay here because some of the other hotels we normally stay at were booked. I read the reviews re: the parking, so I was prepared. Also ready the reviews re: the bad coffee...nothing still prepared me for the horrible stuff they serve. No hot water for tea either.The room just had a general feel of being old and tired. My eight year old grandson panicked when he went to take a shower. He felt as if he was using towels someone else had used.What was the true kicker was when we left. My daughter-in-law left her makeup bag in the room.When we had left a different Anaheim hotel a few months before, they called immediately because I had left my sunglasses there.No one called her.She arrived home and since we arrived late, didn't notice until she was getting ready for work the next day.She called the hotel. At first they said it wasn't there, then changed their minds and said it was.When the bag arrived a few days later - 1/2 of her makeup was missing! (Naturally, the more expensive makeup.)She called the hotel and asked to speak to the manager. He wasn't available. She asked when. They said he would arrive in the late afternoon and he would call her.No call.She called back. Was told she had just missed the manager and the manager wouldn't be until Monday.She called Monday am. The manager wasn't in. She should call back.She wasn't able to talk to manager until Tuesday -- about 4 days AFTER her first call.The manager denied anything was missing. no comments such as: I'm so sorry...I'll look into it. Just a plain denial.We will never, ever stay here again.
1967	2	The only concern that I had was the cleaning service left our hotel room door open while we were away. When we came back, luckily nothing was missing. I would suggest using the safe the hotel provides at NO additional charge.All in all, I found that for the price the location was great. It is directly across the street from the tram entrance and main gate entrance to the two parks. The best thing I found was the Denny's restaurant located at the entrance to the hotel parking lot.
1968	4	We were staying here for our Disney vacation, this hotel is a very short walk from the Disney entrance. There are plenty of breakfast and dinner options around the area/hotel. The room is neat and comfortable with no frills. We were 6 of us and the suite was spacious for us!Did not try the pool, it was not very welcoming.For the price the location is everything!
1969	4	Excellent. Hotel was outstanding and staff very helpful. Room was very large and beds really comfortable. Only complaint was price of car parking which was 70 a night and valet parking. The car lot was approximately 2 blocks away which meant could not car was not easily accessible. Dear G1455JOstephenm, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad Chicago and writing of your experience. I'm pleased you were happy with the accommodations but I'm sorry for your disappointment in our parking rates - unfortunately Chicago does have some of the highest parking and parking tax rates in the entire country! I hope this does not deter you from staying with us again, we look forward to the opportunity. Kind Regards, Tod Chambers
1970	5	I enjoyed our stay here. The staff is accommodating and pleasant. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The sheets, pillows are luxe. We didn't even have to share an elevator ride. I was impressed with our stay. Didn't have to sign in to the wifi each day of our stay. It was the little things at the Conrad that made for a memorable visit in Chicago.Dear 6tribes, Thank you for your recent Conrad Chicago stay and taking time to write about your experience. I'm glad you were able to enjoy the little amenities and service perks that we offer to our guests to ensure that they have a comfortable stay. We look forward to the opportunity to welcome you back. Sincerely, Tod Chambers
1971	5	From the moment we pulled up and were greeted by the valet we were extremely impressed. By far the most beautiful hotel, with the most impeccable service, we have ever stayed at. The rooms were so accommodating with state of the art features. Our family had a surprise party and the area reserved for the event was a perfect balance of comfortable and classy, and the servers were professional and very pleasant. And the food was amazing! We will not stop talking about this experience to others. Dear Madeline B, Thank you for writing about your recent Conrad Chicago and dining experience. We are very much looking forward to having you stay with us again and truly appreciate you talking to your friends and loved ones regarding your experience. I'm glad you appreciated the technology in the guest rooms. We look forward to having you stay with us again. Sincerely, Tod Chambers
1972	5	Great hotel with spacious well appointed rooms. Well located along the Magnificent Mile and within easy walking distance of typical tourist attractions including the architectural boat tours, Millennium Park, the Art Institute, Navy Pier and others. Breakfast was quite good but a bit steep in price if you add any extras. Friendly staff and concierge Jason was very helpful. Dear ahrj, Thank you for staying at the Conrad Chicago and taking time from your day to write us a great review. I am glad you enjoyed our wonderful location and hope that you took full advantage of this to experience all of the wonderful activities Chicago has to offer. Thank you for mentioning the delicious food you had in the restaurant and most especially for specifically mentioning Jason, our concierge. He will certainly be recognized for making your stay unique. We hope you choose to stay with us again in the near future!
1973	5	If being part of the North Bridge Shops is not important to you - this is the place to stay. Most luxurious in the city in my opinion. Staff can't be beat. But location, location, location! Important to know if you are going to Chicago for a specific event.Dear KPupel, Thank you for choosing to stay with us. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay - I know we are no longer conveniently connected to a shopping mall but we are steps away from Michigan Avenue with all of the shopping they have to offer and only 2 short blocks away from the Shops at North Bridge. Thank you for writing a nice review. We look forward to welcome you next time you are in the city. Kind Regards, Amilia Cruz
1974	5	From the very cool top floor lobby and bar to one of the most comfortable rooms weve ever had, this was 5 star. The bed was great and TV excellent. The location cant be much better. The rooftop bar wasnt open yet.....but yet another reason to return.Dear BOVCAT, Thank you for staying at the Conrad Chicago and taking time from your busy day to write a review of your stay. We are glad you enjoyed the accommodations, location, and room amenities. We look forward to welcome you back in the Summer to visit our rooftop restaurant, Noyane, when it opens!
1975	4	The Conrad Chicago was One of the Best Hotels I have ever stayed at! I travel often for business and was blown away from walking into the Conrad, with the Lobby on the 20th floor to the Rooftop Bar. As Diamond Member of Hilton getting a 30 a day meal credit is also huge when traveling for work! Thank you Conrad Chicago Dear wagsj121, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad on your recent visit to Chicago. I am glad you had a wonderful time with us and that we have been one of the best hotels you've stayed at! We thank you for your continued loyalty as a Diamond member and I am delighted you found our food and beverage credit to be useful and of great value. We thank you for taking the time to write a review of your experience and recommend us to other travelers. We look forward to welcome you back soon.
1976	4	This hotel with best location, fantastic design of guestroom and facilities, has become one of my favorite Conrad hotel in this world. I am glad I just finished my second trip to Chicago and this is also the first time for me to stay in the city center.This newly renovated conrad is just located at Michigan Avenue, the most wellknown shopping street in the city. Unlike most hotels in city center, this hotel has the best atmosphere and its modern design really catch my attention. I could have never imagined that I can find such a brilliant modernized hotel in Chicago with this price. Doormen are warmhearted and frontdesk staffs are quite helpful. The restaurant has a fantastic view of Michigan street. The normal guestroom is comparatively small, which could be a concern for those people love spacious room. But it do have a bright and nice bathroom.Dear YuhangHe, Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the Conrad Chicago. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay overall and the design of the hotel itself. We are very proud of the team for all of the nice comments guests such as yourself say about them regarding their helpfulness and friendliness. I appreciate the feedback of the room being a little too small. We look forward to welcome you again next time you are in Chicago!Warm Regards, Kelly Vohs
1977	5	Better located than their prior location (now The Gwen, an SPG LUXURY destination) from staff to dining, from amenities to style enjoy being wrapped in caring competence and composureAdjacent to the best shopping and finer condos this Conrad may be a model for the future of the brandConcierge okAmenities on request excellentEnjoy a new an upcoming property in downtown chicago Dear RMJ11, Thank you for your recent Conrad Chicago visit. I am glad you enjoyed your stay, location and on-site amenities. I appreciate the honest feedback about the concierge - we will definitely work on that. We look forward to seeing you again soon. Sincerely, Tod Chambers
1978	5	Lovely hotel, the rooms are nice, modern and comfortable. The location is excellent and 1 block off Michigan ave.The hotel lobby and restaurant are on the 20th floor which makes for a cool vibe. The restaurant is v well rated and has a great vibe on a Saturday afternoon and evening. For a drink or food its really very good.Nice city views and a huge TV in every room, lovely.Dear Nasher41, Thank you for staying at the Conrad Chicago and taking your time to write a review of your experience. I am glad you had the opportunity to enjoy Baptiste Bottle and your overall experience of the hotel seemed to have went well. Thank you for your recommendation to other travelers. We look forward to welcome you back soon. Sincerely, Tod Chambers
1979	4	A standard upper end business hotel with some Conrad touches, not many. Nothing like Tokyo or Hong Kong. Missing charm and some finishing touches. The rooms are strictly utilitarian. Quiet, comfortable bed, decent coffee maker. Bathroom had no bathtub. Space wasted with huge sink area. Couch was IKEA-like and side table on one side of bed like a lost child. Nothing on it, no reason to be there. Closet was awkwardly placed. The lobby was dramatic but the rooms did not match. Hotel is right off Michigan Ave., close to shops. Its better than the Intercontinental but not in the same class as the Ritz or Four Seasons. Looking for a touch of elegance in the Hilton chain stay at the nearby Waldorf.Dear kev1438, Thank you for choosing the Conrad Chicago and taking time to write a review of your experience. We appreciate the feedback but am sorry you did not find our rooms luxurious and our furnishings lacking. I hope the service you experienced during your stay was helpful and accommodating and we thank you for your feedback.
1980	5	Stayed a the Conrad with my wife over the weekend for a night away. The staff was incredible every step of the way. The room was clean and everything we could have needed was available. The whole process was seamless and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.Dear Oldt1mer23,Thank you for your great review. I'm glad all went well during your stay and that you enjoyed your night away with your wife. We look forward to welcome you again!Kind Regards, Kelly Vohs
1981	5	Hotel location is great. Yards from Michigan but without the chaos. You are greeted by a valet with a smile who asks that you check in on the 20th floor. More smiling, happy folks at the reception desk. Our room was remarkable. The view was terrific but the room was tastefully appointed (a bit on the modern side). We had breakfast at the hotel daily and was very good. The complimentary juice of the day was kinda cool. Roof top bar was hopping and comfortable. All in all, young very accommodating staff, great location and service. We have stayed in Chicago many times. Our new go to place.Dear Sunburned 31, Thank you for taking the time to write a review of your stay. I'm so glad you enjoyed your visit and all of our amenities and services. The team tries hard to make each and every guest happy and I'm glad we were able to turn you into a loyal guest. We look forward to your swift return. Kind Regards, Tod Chambers
1982	4	Conrad is just a few steps or practically on the Magnificent miles ( Michigan Ave) so everything is walking distance. Luxury king bed room is so spacious with the biggest LCD TV I ever seen in a 5* hotels. Very comfortable bed so you can sleep like a baby. Room is also quite ( no noises from other rooms) or even busy Michigan Ave. Nespresso machine. But bathroom is really something, a signature by Conrad. Huge about 6 m long bathroom with the mirror allover the wall. Separate walk-in rainy shower and separate WC. Luxury bathroom amenities. Digital touch everywhere in the room. WiFi is free of charge. What I found as disappointed is breakfast..if you want buffet breakfast the chosen food are so poor...just eggs and bacon, some sweets...nothing else for 26 USD!!!. Really shame. Try to have breakfast somewhere else.Dear Nikac, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad Chicago and taking time to write about your experience. I'm so glad you enjoyed every aspect of our guest room, found it to be comfortable, convenient and up to date with our improved technology. I apologize about the breakfast buffet not having enough variety - we will certainly take this into consideration for future set ups. We hope this does not deter you from staying with us again, we look forward to the opportunity to welcome you back. Kind Regards, Tod Chambers
1983	5	My daughter and I stayed at the Conrad for her 16th birthday. The staff went out of their way to accommodate us with a Michigan Avenue room with an awesome view. The location is just steps away from our favorite stores and many great restaurants. Thank you again to the wonderful staff at the Conrad!Dear 35johannaj, Happy 16th Birthday from the entire Conrad Chicago team! I'm so glad the team went out of their way to make you two comfortable during your visit with us. I appreciate you taking the time to write about your review. We look forward to having you stay with us again. Kind Regards, Tod Chambers
1984	5	The Conrad does not disappoint. Well appointed, large rooms for the city and service that is fantastic. Love an upscale hotel with friendly and professional service and can't recall an instance in which I felt so welcome and appreciated when checking into a hotel.Dear pj8807, Thank you for taking the time to write a nice review of your stay. I'm glad you enjoyed your time with us and the team went out of their way to make your stay special. We look forward to having you with us again soon.
1985	5	Great room. Very Spacious. Bathroom was also very good and well equipped. The staff was very friendly and were very accommodating. Great Location. We would strongly recommend this hotel and would be staying here if visiting Chicago again.Dear ketansmehta, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad Chicago. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay, the accomodations and the team was able to take great care of you during your time here. We look forward to having you stay with us again. Kind Regards, Tod Chambers
1986	5	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Conrad Hotel in downtown Chicago early March and had a wonderful stay. Our guest service rep accommodated our request to stay on a higher floor and away from an elevator. She also congratulated us on our anniversary. Not only did she congratulate us but went above and beyond surprising us with champagne and a hand written note. Thanks to Alina the Conrad will always be our first choice when we stay in Chicago.Dear soccerkidanalise, Thank you for staying at the Conrad Chicago for your special occasion and on behalf of the entire team, Happy Anniversary! I'm glad Alina went above and beyond for the special recognition she gave you during your stay and for providing you with exemplary service. She will certainly be recognized for her great deeds. We are glad you have made us your choice hotel and look forward to welcome you back!
1987	5	I was so happy that I chose this hotel for my visit to Chicago. Everything about the hotel was fantastic. The room was spacious and beautiful. The staff went out of their way to accommodate my needs. I recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.Dear melindap778, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad and writing a review of your stay. The team works hard to make sure that every guest is highly satisfied and comfortable. Thank you for your recommendation. Kind Regards, Amilia Cruz
1988	2	Breakfast, rooms, and all the staff except for the Front desk were great. When my family and I took a shuttle back from Disney we were dropped off 4 minutes away in the middle of the road while it was pouring and when we asked the bus driver he told us to f**k off his bus. No apology or anything. I was told by staff that I would receive some type of compensation (points, etc) however at the end of my stay I was told I will be receiving nothing. I honestly just wanted at least an apology for what my family had to go through that day and if Hilton is nice enough something else. Worst Hilton experience which is sad because my family and I always stay at a Hilton associated property because of the due care they have. Very sad by this stay and even more upset they way I was lied to and the situation was handled.We are sorry we were not able to provide you with a better quality of service. This is not typical of our hotel and staff, and we are always looking for ways to improve our customer experience. Your satisfaction is very important to us and we try hard to make sure all of our guests have a great stay. Thank you for your feedback and we hope you will consider staying with us again.
1989	2	Totally worn towels with a blackish appearance, there was a bunch of hair in the bath-tub that wouldn't drain. Carpets in bad condition, dirty walls, only hot water from the sink, it was hard to get cold water from it. Carpets in bad conditions, only one elevator. Not a good relationship Price/benefit. My best advise is to avoid this hotelThank you for taking the time to share your experience about your recent stay at our hotel. You are among our most valued guests. We sincerely appreciate your feedback and we're very sorry you were unhappy. We will take your comments under consideration as we continually work to improve our guest experience. We hope you will consider staying with us in the future. We have addressed all issues with the housekeeping staff. Please note we start our renovation at the end of this year. Sincerely,Les HarrisGeneral Manager Homewood Suites Les.Harrishilton.com 407-239-4540
1990	5	After having surgery, I needed to recover and needed a comfortable place to rest. The staff made me extremely comfortable. The room was peaceful and I didn't have any issues. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone needing some peaceful rest.
1991	5	I was here for four nights with my husband. It is in a good place, safe, quiet, not far from the attraction areas. It is between Disney and Universal areas. The hotel is located next to the I-4 highway, we had a room looking at the highway and it was good, no noise, you can see the Orlando Premium Outlet and some horses in a vast green area. The staff at the front desk totally helpful and polite. We had one bedroom suite and it was really comfortable, very clean. The free wifi connection excellent. The only thing I didn't like and I got bored was the breakfast. Everyday the same buffet breakfast: sausage and scrambled eggs. I think they should vary it. The dinner was good and delicious. The staff at the breakfast and dinner area very nice and they did a good job. I recommend this hotel and I would stay here again.Hi there zlbenites!Thank you very much for your positive feedback. I 'm so glad to hear that you and your husband enjoyed your stay. It's so refreshing to hear how were doing from you: our valued guest. I want you to know that my team and I take these reviews very seriously. I share every last one with them so they're all aware of how we're all doing. It's encouraging but it also gives us ideas for how to wow future/returning guests. I will definitely share this with the breakfast chef so he knows to add more variety. Thank you again and see you next time!
1992	5	We stayed 8 nights. Great rate found online. Suite was clean and perfect for our family of 5. Only had room cleaned 3 times but crew did a good job. Breakfast crew was very friendly and worked hard. Pool was great on our rest days. Evening social was nice on the 2 nights we attended. Only a mile from Downtown Disney and easy access to highway for a 10 min drive to all parks. Will definitely stay again.
1993	3	We had room for seven but at what price, the breakfast was not good, the placement of the air conditioner had the air blowing on the beds most of the night or you shut it off and it was so hot you died of heat. The one air conditioner was making the floor wet and when I told the lady at the front desk she looked at me like she knew and did not care.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience about your recent stay at our hotel. We sincerely appreciate your feedback and we're very sorry you were unhappy. I know how frustrating the air conditioning issue must have been for you. I will speak to the staff personally to ensure that all notes are recognized when being left by our guest. We will take your comments under consideration as we continually work to improve our guest experience. We hope you will consider staying with us in the future.
1994	5	This was a great hotel. The online check in worked great. Check in was quick. The hotel was nice and conveniently located to attractions. The breakfast was very good. We only were here for one night and arrived late so we were note able to use any of the other amenities.
1995	5	We stayed here for a week while visiting our daughter who is currently working for Disney and stays at The Commons on the other side of the I4. The hotel was ideal for us. Although at check in we were disappointed our booked room (a King Bed Suite) wasn't available, the substitute suite with 2 Queen beds was very acceptable. Rooms were very modern with a fully equipped kitchen and sofa bed in the sitting room and en suite off the bedroom. Maid service excellent and the room was spotless. In room safe very roomy and easy to operate. We enjoyed the breakfast each morning - fruit juice, cereal, toast, muffins, bagels, preserves, cream cheese, eggs, bacon or sausages, most days hash browns, fruit (apples, oranges bananas) and our favourite - waffles. Didn't try the Manager's Reception. Particularly liked the card entry system that let you in to the room and also the leisure areas and extra doors from the car park. Several lifts round the hotel also made room access easy. Excellent value for money.
1996	5	Super happy with this hotel. Location is perfect, right between Disney and Universal. Rooms are clean , comfy and spacious. Free breakfast, free parking, no resort fee and free evening socials. Not a super fancy resort but the best value you can get otherwise. Always a safe bet with Hilton properties. Thank you very much for taking the time to review the hotel. We appreciate your business and hope that you stay with us in the future. Regards, Michael Fatta General Manager
1997	3	I was initially excited it spend 4 nights at this hotel because it meant I wouldn't have to worry about dinner during the week or breakfast since it is complimentary and I was the only adult with 5 kids under the age of 14. However what a disappointment the food was! The eggs tasted like slime. The mini Mickey waffles were always undercook even with the timer. The orange juice was always too watered down. It tasted more like water with orange flavor. And there was never any bacon! No American breakfast is complete without bacon. Don't even get me started on the dinner. Yes it was so bad we had to order papa johns pizza on Wednesday night and after giving the dinner another chance on Thursday we still had to order out. The pullout bed was terrible. I felt bad that my nieces had to sleep on it. I've never been to prison but I could imagine that prison beds were better than the coil bed they were sleeping on. It was so bad one of my nieces ended up sleeping on the couch and the other on the floor with extra blankets as her cushion. The kitchen, though very small, ended up being great because I was able to go to a local grocery store and stock up on snacks and cold cuts for the kids. If you are like me and are staying here for the benefit of food, don't do it. The food is something I would never serve to my own family. And if you are planing to use the pullout bed than plan for a bad nights rest for whoever has to sleep on it. I have stood in other Homewood suites and I am a Hilton Honors member so I expected it to be better but it wasn't. However everything in the room was clean. The maid was very diligent and I liked being able to use the laundry on site. The staff was also very friendly, especially the lady that works at the check in desk at night. Simply put, if the food was better quality and better tasting like other Homewood suites than it would get more stars.
1998	2	Poor cleanliness. Lack of attention to coffee station. Selected room online and put somewhere else. Breakfast selections were limited. Dishes not clean at breakfast. Parking was a fiasco. Would never stay here again. Would run to the nearest alternative hotel.
1999	5	We stayed here in June, 2014 for a week-long vacation in Orlando. Though very close to Disney, it was less then ten minutes to SeaWorld and only about a 12 minute drive to Universal Studios. The road the hotel is located on can get you to all the major parks without getting on the interstate.We had a one-bedroom suite which worked out great. It was a nice property and well-maintained. The pool and other facilities were really nice. Daily housekeeping was wonderful. It was very convenient to have a kitchen and full sized refrigerator since we were there for the week. If you are going to Orlando to do the parks, I highly recommend this property.
2000	4	I researched MANY different hotels in the Orlando area before finally deciding on this one. I wanted a nice pool, free internet, and a free hot breakfast. We booked a king studio suite and were really impressed. Our room was lovely, with a very comfortable bed and nice kitchen area with everything we would have needed. We were on the 1st floor near the pool and the room was surprisingly quiet. The pool was nice but a little cold, I don't think it was heated. Also, the lounge chairs look nice but they were really uncomfortable for laying on. I would also recommend that the pool area be smoke free. While relaxing by the pool a man decided to smoke his cigar about 5 feet away from us. I very nicely asked him to move since I suffer from asthma, and while he was happy to move I could still smell his smoke from across the pool. We had a great sleep and woke up around 8 the next morning to get our free breakfast. The breakfast area was absolutely packed and they were out of a lot of the food. Had it been fully stocked there would have been scrambled eggs, sausage, breakfast potatoes, a few different types of cereal, yogurt, bagels, and other breakfast pastries. There was also milk, juice, and coffee. This was pretty disappointing considering the amount of hotel staff just kind of standing around the breakfast area. My husband was able to find something to eat but I ended up eating leftovers in our room. Not a big deal but something that definitely needs improvement.Overall our room was extremely clean and the area was perfect. We were really close to the freeway but still found it quiet enough to get a good nights sleep.
2001	4	Close to Disney, great value, good breakfast, nice rooms. The pool is clean and always had towels. Front desk was very responsive. Bathroom shower drain was a little slow. Room was clean and good size
2002	4	Our group of 6 stayed at this hotel over spring break for 9 days. The free breakfast and dinners allowed for a lot of flexibility- we could grab something to eat without wasting any vacation time. The room kitchen was completely stocked with a full size refrigerator, stove, microwave, dishwasher and a full set of dishes, utensils, coffee maker, toaster, cutting board, can opener. A stop at the nearby Walmart and we were set for the week. The staff was very hard working in the dining and pool area- food and towels were constantly replenished respectively. All staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean as was the pool area. I would highly recommend this hotel to others, and would stay there again myself!
2003	2	Everything was good until we received our bill. We confirmed our reservation on the phone before arrival at 107 a night. At check in, we were told to initial next to our room rate of 107 a night. On departure date we discover there is a charge of 125 for the second night. We asked to see the card we signed when we arrived and it certainly did have 107 next to our initials in the top right hand corner, but over to the left in small print it said 125 for second night. So, here is another scam we must all be aware of, and worse, the person at the desk just turned his head away and said sorry about that. Actually, sorry about that right back to you, because we will never stay at a Homewood Suites again with such deceptive trickery. If you are still thinking of staying here, be aware that one side of the hotel faces Interstate I 4 and is extremely noisy.Hello rtwo dThank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. First and foremost, I'm glad that you enjoyed your stay. However, I'm also glad that you shared your concerns in this review. I have to apologize for the billing issues. Please know that we in no way participate/promote scams or any type of deception to our guests. We all make sure to inform all of our guests about rate changes when we make reservations and also during the check in process. Now, we will all make sure to emphasize this information even more to ensure that no one else has this happen to them. In addition, I hope that you decide to give us another chance in the future. It would be our pleasure to accommodate you and your family again. Take care and hope to see you soon.
2004	4	Was Leary about booking this property because of the location in the busiest part of town, but it turned out great. We took the back roads to most of our meetings and that was fantastic. Very friendly staff, good breakfast and clean rooms. Self parking well lit and easy access. Good place to stay with family as well as business. Would recommend.
2005	4	We stayed in this Homewood Suites while traveling to Disney for the Walt Disney World Marathon. The staff was very friendly, and our room was ready early, which was great because we arrived on a Friday morning. The room was clean, smoke free and the beds were quite comfortable. My only suggestion would be that if you are traveling down specifically to go to Disney World, you might want to consider how much your taxi rides will cost from the hotel to the Disney properties. While all of the maps we looked at said the hotel was only 3-5 miles from Disney, each of our cab rides cost between 25-30, depending on which park we were at that day. The hotel does have a shuttle to Epcot, but is limited. This would have been a great location if we had brought our car, but was a little remote when just relying on taxis. Overall, a great hotel, just consider its location!
2006	5	This was a great experience friendly check in, clean and comfortable room. Very well maintained Hotel. Breakfast was a good breakfast for the complimentary breakfast, if any suggestions on breakafast would be to offer bacon, along with the sausage, and as well to offer whole milk as an option as well, this coming from 3 out of 4 people in our party. Other then that reccomendation, Hotel was comfortable and clean. Never got to use the pool. Would stay here again : ) front desk satff very attentive and friendly. Loved thAT THE BEDROOM WAS SEPERATE FROM THE REST OF THE ASUITE, THE KITCHEN WAS COZY ONLY STAYED FOR ONE NIGHT WOULD DEFINATLY GO BACK AND STAY LONGER.
2007	4	Have vacationed at the Homewood Suites Lake Buena Vista several time over the years, this time stayed while in the area for business. Front desk staff was friendly as usual. Had a room overlooking the pool area. Room was clean and in good condition. AC worked well and kept the room very cool which is important in Orlando in July. Evening reception was stuffed shells, garlic breadsticks, soup and salad. Food was tasty and filling. Sleep quality was good, room quiet. Breakfast was the usual Homewood fare, and was well stocked despite the crowds. Sorry to hear Jean (John) Louie has left as he was a great asset to the hotel. Another really nice stay at this hotel.
2008	4	My husband I and three children ages 11,6 7 stayed here for a week(6/8-6/14) for our Disney trip.It was nice to have extra space and a full kitchen however we did not use the stove or dishwasher but the full fridge/freezer was nice to utilize for our snacks drinks. We would freeze our water bottles the night before and our water would stay nice and cold until mid afternoon at the parks.Beds were comfortable clean. Sofa bed mattress was very thin and I did not think my 11year old would be comfortable but she did not complain. I do not think it would be comfy for and adult. Linens were clean upon arrival however when they were changed upon my request on the 3rd day I did notice some linens towels were a little dingy NOT dirty but dingy (I think if they look like that they should be thrown away and replaced)Upon arrival the room appeared clean however the bathroom dresser drawers were dusty and had hair in them. I cleaned them out and used paper towels to line them before putting our belongings in them.It did not appear that housekeeping vacuumed,swept or mopped our entire stay.The floors in and outside of elevators were not cleaned regularly either(one morning there was a sticky spill outside the main elevator when we left early in the morning it was still there when we arrived back at the hotel late that evening.Breakfast was decent for about 2 days then you do not want it anymore because its repetitive. I have read complaints about a worker being rude during breakfast hours. I experienced that myself I said hello twice to this man then a 3rd to see if he was for real and he totally ignored me,I also heard him actually reprimand a guest for not understanding how to use the cereal dispenser. The manager really needs to discuss proper etiquette to him or find another position for him because no one deserves to start their morning with that kind of disrespect however there is another gentleman who works during this time also he works his tail off and he is so super nice and deserves a raise )The pool was nice.The hot tub when we stayed smelled and looked very dirty.I wish there was designated smoking area enforced also.It is awful when you do not smoke and to have to sit around it and walk through it.The hotel is right off I-4 and Disney is one exit from the hotel makes for a great location!There are several restaurants around the hotel to choose from.Despite minor quirks I would stay here again! I referred my sister and she booked for her upcoming trip. It is a nice hotel staff members other than that one I mentioned were very nice.
2009	5	The rooms were very comfortable and quiet at an excellent price. Our particular room had a separate living room/kitchenette area and bedroom. The included morning breakfast was more than adequate and although we did not partake in the evening weekday meals, they too looked good. For a traveling family, this is a real bargain. The staff was extremely courteous. Will definitely stay here again, when we are in the Orlando area
2010	5	We got a great deal on the hotel which included breakfast and a cocktail (we never got to the cocktail as we were always outside of the hotel during dinner time). The hotel was very clean and the service was great. Even though the hotel was full, you never felt it inside. The breakfast was never good, however a little repetitive with no real major choice changes throughout our stay. If they added a few extra items and had different choices for breakfast during the week would put this hotel over the top. However, I highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a cheaper alternative to staying at a Disney (on-site) hotel.
2011	5	Manager was very nice. Bed was comfy, bathroom was big, and had a nice array of toiletries, a microwave and fridge. Very decent price and very quiet. Near all the attractions. Will definatly be staying here again when I visit CA.
2012	5	We have stayed in unit six both times we have come to this resort. It has the option of being a one or two bedroom unit with a kitchen, living area, screened in porch, and one or two bathes. It's comfortably appointed with excellent beds, comfortable furniture, and very clean. The prices here are a bargain! There is a nice... More
2013	5	We spent a weekend here for a bachelor party, and it was perfect. The owners were very polite and accommodating, and the son is one helluva cook. Be aware that the closest town is a bit of a drive, so come prepared with everything you need. You couldn't find a better place to spend the weekend for the money.
2014	5	The staff at this location were exceptional friendly and courteous. They made me feel welcome and even acknowledged me when leaving and returning during my stay. The location is perfect and accessible to many attractions in the area. I am from Hampton and don't find it necessary to stay in a hotel often but this will be my new home... More
2015	4	Clean facility just off freeway ..... staff friendly and efficient .... good breakfast choices. We will stay here again for follow up visits with doctors at UT Northeast and recommend it for others requiring expected high standards from Hilton properties.
